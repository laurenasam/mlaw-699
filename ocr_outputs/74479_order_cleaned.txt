The employer assures that if a change in the AEWR requires an increase in the guaranteed minimum, such increase will be paid as of the effective date of the increase. If the worker's piece rate earnings for a pay period results in average hourly earnings of less than the guaranteed minimum, the worker will be provided make-up pay to the guaranteed minimum rate. PIECE WAGE RATE: If a Piece Rate is offered on the job order, the work performed at the piece rate will be guaranteed to the workers for the stated period of employment unless crop activity will not realize the workers an hourly equivalent of at least the current AEWR.

If before the expiration date specified in the work contract, the services of the worker are no longer required for reasons beyond the control of the employer due to fire, weather, or other Act of God that makes the fulfillment of the contract impossible, the employer may terminate the work contract. Whether such an event constitutes a contract impossibility will be determined by the CO. In the event of such termination of a contract the employer must fulfill a three-fourths guarantee for the time that has elapsed from the start of the work contract to the time of its termination, as described in paragraph (i) (1) of this section. The employer must make efforts to transfer the worker to other comparable employment acceptable to the worker, consistent with existing immigration law, as applicable. If such transfer is not affected, the employer must:(1) Return the worker, at the employers expense, to the place from which the worker (disregarding intervening employment) came to work for the employer, or transport the worker to the workers next certified H-2A employer, whichever the worker prefers; (2) Reimburse the worker the full amount of any deductions made from the worker's pay by the employer for transportation and subsistence expenses to the place of employment; and (3) Pay the

The amount of the transportation payment must be NO less (and is not required to be more) than most economical and reasonable common carrier transportation charges for the distances involved. , work guarantee: The employer will guarantee to offer the worker employment for at least three-fourths of the workdays of the total periods during which the work contract and all extensions thereof are in effect, beginning with the first workday after the arrival of the worker at the place of employment and ending on the expiration date specified in the work contract or in its extensions, if any. If the employer offers the worker during the total work contract period less employment than is required under this work guarantee the employer shall pay such worker the amount, which the worker would have earned had the worker in fact, worked for the guaranteed number of days. For purposes of this guarantee, a workday shall mean the number of hours in a workday, excluding the workers Sabbath and Federal Holidays. A worker may be offered more than the specified hours of work on a single workday, including the workers Sabbath and Federal Holidays. For the purposes of meeting the guarantee, however the worker shall not be required to work for more than the number of hours specified in this job order for a workday, or on the workers Sabbath or Federal Holiday. In determining whether the guarantee of employment has been met, any hours which the worker fails to work during a workday when the worker is offered the opportunity to do so by the employer and hours of work performed shall be counted in calculating the employment guarantee.
