Clearance Order Assurances By filing and interstate clearance order, the employer agrees to abide by the interstate clearance order regulations and makes the following assurances: 1. The employer will provide workers referred through the employers Clearance Order with a full week of employment for the week beginning with the date of Need stated in Item #9 of the Clearance Order, unless the employer amends such Date of need at least 10 working days prior, by so notifying the appropriate ES Office. The employer will pay workers recruited through this clearance Order the rate specified in the Clearance Order for the first weeks starting with original date of need. The employer retains this option, however, of requiring the worker to perform the alternative Specified in the Clearance of order, if the guarantee in this section is invoked. If the period of employment is extended beyond that specified in the Clearance Order, the employer will not be relieved from paying the wage already earned, and from providing transportation or paying transportation expenses as provided in the Clearance Order regulations. The working conditions of this job offer comply with applicable Federal and State minimum wage, child labor, social security, health and safety, migrant and seasonal farm worker and other employment related laws. The employer will expeditiously notify the appropriate ES office by telephone upon learning that his/her crop is maturing earlier or later, or that weather conditions, over recruitment, or other factors have changed the terms and conditions of employment being offered by the employer. The employer, if acting as a Farm Labor Contractor (FLC) or Farm Labor Contractor Employer (FLCE) on the order, has a valid FLC certificate or FLCB identification card. The employer will provide housing which meets Federal standards and is sufficient to house the number of workers requested through the Clearance System. The housing will be provided at no cost to the workers who are referred on this order, and when applicable, family members, as provided in Item #3 of the Clearance Order, who are unable to return to their residence on the same day. Employment service staff (including outreach workers) shall have reasonable access to workers in the conduct of outreach activities. This job order describes the actual terms and conditions of the employment being offered by the employer and contains all the material terms and conditions of the job. In accordance with Departmental regulations 20 CFR sec. 655.122(0). If before the expiration date specified in the work contract, the services of the worker are no longer required for reasons beyond the control of the employer due to fire, weather, or other Act of God that makes the fulfillment of the contract impossible, the employer may terminate the work contract. Whether such an event constitutes a contract impossibility will be determined by the CO. In the event of such termination of a contract the employer must fulfill a three-fourths guarantee for the time that has elapsed from the start of the work contract to the time of its termination, as described in paragraph (i) (1) of this section. The employer must make efforts to transfer the worker to other comparable employment acceptable to the worker, consistent with existing immigration law, as applicable. If such transfer is not affected, the employer must:(1) Return the worker, at the employers expense, to the place from which the worker (disregarding intervening employment) came to work for the employer, or transport the worker to the workers next certified H-2A employer, whichever the worker prefers; (2) Reimburse the worker the full amount of any deductions made from the worker's pay by the employer for transportation and subsistence expenses to the place of employment; and (3) Pay the worker for any costs incurred by the worker for transportation and daily subsi eng, to that employer's place of employment. Daily subsistence must be computed as set forth in 20CFR 655.122(h) (1) which is $4sQ9 per day $51.00 is the maximum amount for travel reimbursement for meals. The amount of the transportation payment must be NO less (and is not required to be more) than most economical and reasonable common carrier transportation charges for the distances involved. . work guarantee: The employer will guarantee to offer the worker employment for at least three-fourths of the workdays of the total periods during which the work contract and all extensions thereof are in effect, beginning with the first workday after the arrival of the worker at the place of employment and ending on the expiration date specified in the work contract or in its extensions, if any. If the employer offers the worker during the total work contract period less employment than is required under this work guarantee the employer shall pay such worker the amount, which the worker would have earned had the worker in fact, worked for the guaranteed number of days. For purposes of this guarantee, a workday shall mean the number of hours in a workday, excluding the workers Sabbath and Federal Holidays. A worker may be offered more than the specified hours of work on a single workday, including the workers Sabbath and Federal Holidays. For the purposes of meeting the guarantee, however the worker shall not be required to work for more than the number of hours specified in this job order for a workday, or on the workers Sabbath or Federal Holiday. In determining whether the guarantee of employment has been met, any hours which the worker fails to work during a workday when the worker is offered the opportunity to do so by the employer and hours of work performed shall be counted in calculating the employment guarantee.
