# 📂 Data Access Statement

## 📌 Overview

The HTC provided a spreadsheet containing H-2A job order case numbers and corresponding links to publicly available job listings on the U.S. Department of Labor's SeasonalJobs.gov website. Our team manually accessed and downloaded these job orders to build the dataset used in this analysis.
