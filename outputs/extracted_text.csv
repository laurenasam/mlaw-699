H-2A Case Number: ___________ _______ __      Case Status: __________________       Determination Date : ___________ __     Validity Period : ____________ _ to ___________ __ I. Conditions of Employment and Assurance s for H-2A Agricultural Clearance Orders
By virtue of my signature below, I HEREBY CERTIFY  my knowledge of and compliance with applicable Federal, State, and local employment-
related laws and regulations, including employment-related health and safety laws, and certify the following conditions of employment: 
1. JOB OPPORTUNITY :  Employer assures that the job opportunity identified in this clearance order (hereinafter also referred to as the “job
order”) is a full -time temporary position being placed with the SWA in connection with an H-2A Application for Temporary Employment
Certification for H- 2A workers and this clearance order satisfies the requirements for agricultural clearance orders in 20 CFR 653, subpart F
and the requirements set forth in 20 CFR 655.122.  This job opportunity offers U.S. workers no less than the same benefits, wages, and
working conditions that the employer is offering, intends to offer, or will provide to H- 2A workers and complies with the requirements at 20
CFR 655, Subpart B.  The job opportunity is open to any qualified U.S. worker regardless of race, color, national origin, age, sex, religion,
handicap, or citizenship.
2. NO STRIKE, LOCKOUT, OR WORK STOPPAGE :  Employer assures that  this job opportunity, including all worksites for which the
employer is requesting H-2A labor certification does not currently have workers  on strike or being locked out in the course of a labor
dispute.  20 CFR 655.135(b).
3. HOUSING FOR WORKERS :  Employer agrees to provide for or secure housing for H- 2A workers and those workers in corresponding
employment who are not reasonably able to return to their residence at the end of the work day.  That housing complies  with the applicable
local, State, or Feder al standards and is sufficient to house the specified number of workers requested through the clearance system .  The
employer will provide the housing without charge to the worker.  Any charges for rental housing will be paid directly by the employer to the
owner or operator of the housing.  If public accommodations are provided to workers , the employer agrees to pay all housing-related
charges directly to the housing's management.  The employer agrees that charges in the form of deposits for bedding or other  similar
incidentals related to housing (e.g., utilities) must not be levied upon workers.  However, the employer may  require workers to reimburse
them for damage caused to housing by the individual worker(s) found to have been responsible for damage which is not the result of normal
wear and tear related to habitation.  When it is the prevailing practice in the area of intended employment and the occupation to provide
family housing, the employer agrees to provide family housing at no cost to workers with families who request it. 20 CFR 655.122(d),
653.501(c)(3)(vi).
Request for Conditional Access  to Intrastate or Interstate Clearance System :  Employer assures that the housing disclosed on this 
clearance order will be in full compliance with all applicable local, State, or Federal standards at least 20 calendar days before the housing 
is to be occupied. 20 CFR 653.502(a)(3).  The Certifying Officer will not certify the application until the housing has been inspected and 
approved. 
4. WORKERS’ COMPENSATION COV ERAGE :  Employer agrees to provide workers' compensation insurance coverage in compliance with
State law covering injury and disease arising out of and in the course of the worker's employment.  If the type of employment for which the
certification is sought is not covered by or is exempt from the State's workers' compensation law, the employer agrees to provide, at no cost
to the worker, insurance covering injury and disease arising out of and in the course of the worker's employment that will provide benefits at
least equal to those provided under the State workers' compensation law for other comparable employment.  20 CFR 655.122(e).
5. EMPLOYER -PROVIDED TOOLS AND EQUIPMENT :  Employer agrees to  provide to the worker, without charge or deposit charge, all
tools, supplies, and equipment required to perform the duties assigned.  20 CFR 655.122(f).
6. MEALS :  Employer agrees to provide each worker with three meals a day or furnish free and convenient cooking and kitchen facilities to the
workers that will enable the workers to prepare their own meals.  Where the employer provides the meals, the job offer will state the charge,
if any, to the worker for such meals.  The amount of meal charges is governed by 20 CFR 655.173. 20 CFR 655.122(g).
For workers engaged in the herding or production of livestock on the range, the employer agrees to provide each worker, without charge or
deposit charge, (1) either three sufficient meals a day, or free and convenient cooking facilities and adequate provision of food to enable the
worker to prepare his own meals.   To be sufficient or adequate, the meals or food provided must include a daily source of protein, vitamins,
and minerals; and (2) adequate potable water, or water that can be easily rendered potable and the means to do so.  20 CFR 655.210(e).
7. TRANSPORTATION  AND DAILY SUBSISTENCE :  Employer agrees to provide the following transportation and daily subsistence benefits
to eligible workers.  
A. Transportation to Place of Employment (Inbound)
If the worker completes 50 percent of the work contract period, and the employer did not directly provide such transportation or 
subsistence or otherwise has not yet paid the worker for such transportation or subsistence costs, the employer agrees to reimburse 
the worker for reasonable costs incurred by the worker for transportation and daily subsistence from the place from which the worker 
has come to work for the employer, whether in the U.S. or abroad to the place of employment.  The amount of the transportation 
payment must be no less (and is not required to be more) than the most economical and reasonable common carrier transportation 
charges for the distances involved.  The amount the employer will pay for daily subsistence expenses are  those amounts disclosed in 
this clearance order, which are at least as much as the employer would charge the worker for providing the worker with three meals a 
day during employment (if applicable), but in no event will less than the amount permitted under 20 CFR 655.173(a).  The employer 
understands that the F air Labor Standards Act applies independently of the H- 2A requirements and imposes obligations on employers 
regarding payment of wages. 20 CFR 655.122(h)(1). 
B. Transportation from Place of Employment (Outbound)

H-2A Case Number: ___________ _______ __      Case Status: __________________       Determination Date : ___________ __     Validity Period : ____________ _ to ___________ __ If the worker has contracted with a subsequent employer who has not agreed in such work contract to provide or pay for the worker's 
transportation and daily subsistence expenses from the employer's worksite to such subsequent employer's worksite, the employer 
must provide for such expenses.  If the worker has contracted with a subsequent employer who has agreed in such work contract to 
provide or pay for the worker's transportation and daily subsistence expenses from the employer's worksite to such subsequent 
employer's worksite, the subsequent employer must provide or pay for such expenses. 
The employer is not relieved of its obligation to provide or pay for return transportation and subsistence if an H- 2A worker is displaced 
as a result of the employer's compliance with the 50 percent rule as described in sec. 655.135(d) of this subpart with respect to the 
referrals made after the employer's date of need. 20 CFR 655.122(h)(2). 
C. Daily Transportation
Employer agrees to provide transportation between housing provided or secured by the employer and the employer’s worksite(s) at no 
cost to the worker. 20 CFR 655.122(h)(3). 
D. Compliance with Transportation Standards
Employer assures that al l employer- provided transportation will comply with all applicable Federal, State, or local laws and regulations. 
Employer agrees to provide, at a minimum, the same transportation safety standards, driver licensure, and vehicle insurance as 
required under  29 U.S.C. 1841 and 29 CFR 500.105 and 29 CFR 500.120 to 500.128.  If workers' compensation is used to cover 
transportation, in lieu of vehicle insurance, the employer will ensure that such workers' compensation covers all travel or that vehicle 
insurance exists to provide coverage for travel not covered by workers' compensation.  Employer agrees to have property damage 
insurance.  20 CFR 655.122(h)(4). 
8. THREE- FOURTHS GUARANTEE :  Employer agrees to offer the worker employment for a total number of work hours equal to at least
three- fourths of the workdays of the total period beginning with the first workday after the arrival of the worker at the place of employment or
the advertised contractual first date of need, whichever is later, and ending on the expiration date specified in the work contract or in its
extensions, if any.  20 CFR 655.122(i).
The employer may offer the worker more than the specified hours of work on a single workday.  For purposes of meeting the three -fourths 
guarantee, the worker will not be required to work for more than the number of hours specified in the job order for a workday, or on the 
worker's Sabbath or Federal holidays.  If, during the total work contract period, the employer affords the U.S. or H -2A worker less 
employment than that required under this guarantee, the employer will pay such worker the amount the worker would have earned had the 
worker, in fact, worked for the guaranteed number of days.   An employer will not be considered to have met the work guarantee if the 
empl oyer has merely offered work on three -fourths of the workdays if each workday did not consist of a full number of hours of work time as 
specified in the job order.  All hours of work actually performed may be counted by the employer in calculating whether the period of 
guaranteed employment has been met.  Any hours the worker fails to work, up to a maximum of the number of hours specified in the job 
order for a workday, when the worker has been offered an opportunity to work, and all hours of work actually performed (including voluntary 
work over 8 hours in a workday or on the worker's Sabbath or Federal holidays), may be counted by the employer in calculating whether the 
period of guaranteed employment has been met.  20 CFR 655.122(i). 
If the worker is paid on a piece rate basis, the employer agrees to use the worker's average hourly piece rate earnings or the required 
hourly wage rate, whichever is higher, to calculate the amount due under the three-fourths guarantee.  20 CFR 655.122(i). 
If the worker voluntarily abandons employment before the end of the period of employment set forth in the job order, or is terminated for 
cause, and the employer follows the notification requirements in 20 CFR 655.122(n), the worker is not entitled to the three-fourths 
guarantee.  The employer is not liable for payment of the three- fourths guarantee to an H- 2A worker whom the Department of Labor 
certifies is displaced due to the employer's requirement to hire qualified and available U.S. workers during the recruitment period set out in 
20 CPR 655.135(d), which lasts until 50 percent of the period of the work contract has elapsed (50 percent rule).  20 CFR 655.122(i). 
Important Note:  In circumstances where the work contract is terminated due to contract impossibility  under 20 CFR 655.122(o), the three-
fourths guarantee period ends on the date of termination.   
9. EARNINGS RECORDS :  Employer agrees to keep accurate and adequate records with respect to the workers' earnings at the place or
places of employment, or at one or more  established central recordkeeping offices where such records are customarily maintained.  All
records must be available for inspection and transcription by the Department of Labor or a duly authorized and designated representative,
and by the worker and representatives designated by the worker as evidenced by appropriate documentation.  Where the records are
maintained at a central recordkeeping office, other than in the place or places of employment, such records must be made available for
inspection and copying within 72 hours following notice from the Department of Labor, or a duly authorized and designated representative,
and by the worker and designated representatives.  The content of earnings records must meet all regulatory requirements and be retai ned
by the employer for a period of not less than 3 years after the date of certification by the Department of Labor.  20 CFR 655.122(j).
10. HOURS AND EARNINGS STATEMENTS:  Employer agrees to furnish to the worker on or before each payday in one or more written
statements the following information: (1) the worker's total earnings for the pay period; (2) the worker's hourly rate and/or piece rate of pay;
(3)the hours of employment offered to the worker (showing offers in accordance with the three- fourths guarantee as determined in 20 CFR
655.122(i), separate from any hours offered over and above the guarantee); (4) the hours actually worked by the worker; (5) an itemization
of all deductions made from the worker's wages; (6) If piece rates are used, the units produced daily; (7) beginning and ending dates of the
pay period; and (8) the employer's name, address and FEIN.  20 CFR 655.122(k).
For workers engaged in the herding or production of livestock on the range, the employer is exempt from recording and furnishing the hours 
actually worked each day, the time the worker begins and ends each workday, as well as the nature and amount of work performe d, but 
otherwise must comply with the earnings records and hours and earnings statement requirements set out in 20 CFR 655.122(j) and (k) .  
The employer agrees to keep daily records indicating whether the site of the employee's work was on the range or off the range.  If the 
employer prorates a worker's wage because of the worker's voluntary absence for personal reasons, it must also keep a record of the 
reason for the worker's absence. 20 CFR 655.210(f).

H-2A Case Number: ___________ _______ __      Case Status: __________________       Determination Date : ___________ __     Validity Period : ____________ _ to ___________ __ 11. RATES OF PAY:  The employer agrees that it will offer, advertise in its recruitment, and pay at least the Adverse Effect Wage Rate
(AEWR), the prevailing hourly wage rate, the prevailing piece rate, the agreed- upon collective bargaining rate, or the Federal or State
minimum wage rate, in effect at the time work is performed, whichever is highest.  If the worker is paid by the hour, the employer must pay
this rate for every hour or portion thereof worked during a pay period.  If the offered wage(s) disclosed in this clearance order  is/are based
on commission, bonuses, or other incentives, the employer guarantees the wage paid on a weekly, semi -monthly, or monthly basis  will
equal or exceed the AEWR, prevailing hourly wage or piece rate, the legal Federal or State minimum wage, or any agreed -upon collective
bargaining rate, whichever is highest.
If the worker is paid on a piece rate basis and at the end of the pay period the piece rate does not result in average hourly piece rate
earnings during the pay period at least equal to the amount the worker would have earned had the worker been paid at the appr opriate
hourly rate of pay, the employer agrees to supplement the worker's pay at that time so that the worker's earnings are at least as much as
the worker would have earned during the pay period if the worker had instead been paid at the appropriate hourly wage rate for each hour
worked.  20 CFR 655.120, 655.122(l).
For workers engaged in the herding or production of livestock on the range, the employer agrees to pay the worker at least the monthly 
AEWR, the agreed-upon collective bargaining wage, or the applicable minimum wage imposed by Federal or State law or judicial action, in 
effect at the time work is performed, whichever is highest, for every month of the job order period or portion thereof.  If the offered wage 
disclosed in this clearance order is  based on commissions, bonuses, or other incentives, the employer as sures that the wage paid will equal 
or exceed the monthly AEWR, the agreed -upon collective bargaining wage, or the applicable minimum wage imposed by Federal or State 
law or judicial action, whichever is highest, and will be paid to each worker free and clear without any unauthorized deductions.  The 
employer may prorate the wage for the initial and final pay periods of the job order period if its pay period does not match the beginning or 
ending dates of the job order.   The employer also may prorate the wage if an employee is voluntarily unavailable to work for personal 
reasons.  20 CFR 655.210(g). 
12. FREQUENCY OF PAY :  Employer agrees to pay workers when due based on the frequency disclosed in this clearance order.  20 CFR
655.122(m). 
13. ABANDONMENT OF EMPLOYM ENT OR TERMINATION FOR CAUSE :  If a worker voluntarily abandons employment before the end of
the contract period, or is terminated for cause, employer is not responsible for providing or paying for the subsequent transportation and
subsistence expenses of that worker, and that worker is not entitled to the three- fourths guarantee, if the employer notifies the Department
of Labor and, if applicable, the Department of Homeland Security, in writing or by any other method specified by the Department of Labor or
the Department of Homeland Security in the Federal Register, not later than 2 working days after the abandonment or termination occurs.
A worker  will be deemed to have abandoned the work contract if the worker  fails to show up for work at the regularly s cheduled time and
place for 5 consecutive work days without the consent of the employer.  20 CFR 655.122(n).
14. CONTRACT IMPOSSIBILITY : The work contract may be terminated before the end date of work specified in the work contract if
the services of the workers are no longer required for reasons beyond the control of the employer due to fire, weather, or other Act of God
that makes fulfillment of the contract impossible, as determined by the U.S. Department of Labor.  In the event that the work contract is
terminated, the employer agrees to fulfill  the three-fourths guarantee for the time that has elapsed from the start date of work specified in
the work contract to the date of termination.  The employer also agrees that it will make efforts to transfer the worker to other comparable
employment acceptable to the worker and consistent with existing immigration laws.  In situations where a transfer is not affected, the
employer agrees to return the worker at the employer’s expense to the place from which the worker, disregarding intervening employment,
came to work for the employer , or transport the worker to his/her next certified H -2A employer, whichever the worker prefers.  The employer
will also reimburse the worker the full amount of any deductions made by the employer from the worker’s pay for transportation and
subsistence expenses to the place of employment .  The employer will also pay the worker for any transportation and subsistence expenses
incurred by the worker to that employer’s place of employment.  The amounts the employer will pay for subsistence expenses per day are
those amounts disclosed in this  clearance order .  The amount of the transportation payment must not be less (and is not required to be
more) than the most economical and reasonable common carrier transportation charges for the distances involved. 20 CFR 655.122(o).
The employer is not required to pay for transportation and daily subsistence from the place of employment to a subsequent employer’s 
worksite  if the worker has contracted with a subsequent employer who has agreed to provide or pay for the worker’s transportation and 
subsistence expenses from the present employer’s worksite to the subsequent employer’s worksite.   20 CFR 655.122(h)(2). 
15. DEDUCTIONS FROM WORKER’S PAY : Employer a grees to make all deductions from the worker’s paycheck required by law.  This  job
offer discloses all deductions not required by law which the employer will make from  the worker’s paycheck and all such deductions are
reasonable, in accordance with 20 CFR 655.122(p) and 29 CFR part 531.  The wage requirements of 20 CFR 655.120 will not be met
where undisclosed or unauthorized deductions, rebates, or refunds reduce the wage payment made to the employee below the minimum
amounts required under 20 CFR part 655, subpart B, or where the employee fails to receive such amounts free and clear because the
employee kicks back directly or indirectly to the employer or to another person for the employer’s benefit the whole or part of the wage
delivered to the employee.  20 CFR 655.122(p).
16. DISCLOSURE OF WORK CONTRACT : Employer agrees to provide a copy of the work contract to an H- 2A worker no later than the time at
which the worker applies for the visa, or to a worker in corresponding employment no later than on the day work commences.  For an H-2A
worker coming to the employer from another H- 2A employer, the employer agrees to provide a copy of the work contract no later than the
time an offer of employment is made to the H -2A worker.  A copy of the work contract will be provided to each worker in a language
understood by the worker, as necessary or reasonable.  In the absence of a separate, written work contract entered into between the
employer and the worker, the required terms of this clearance order , including all Addendums, and the certified H-2A Application for
Temporary Employment Certification will be the work contract. 20 CFR 655.122(q).

H-2A Case Number: ___________ _______ __      Case Status: __________________       Determination Date : ___________ __     Validity Period : ____________ _ to ___________ __ I. Conditions of Employment and Assurance s for H-2A Agricultural Clearance Orders
By virtue of my signature below, I HEREBY CERTIFY  my knowledge of and compliance with applicable Federal, State, and local employment-
related laws and regulations, including employment-related health and safety laws, and certify the following conditions of employment: 
1. JOB OPPORTUNITY :  Employer assures that the job opportunity identified in this clearance order (hereinafter also referred to as the “job
order”) is a full -time temporary position being placed with the SWA in connection with an H-2A Application for Temporary Employment
Certification for H- 2A workers and this clearance order satisfies the requirements for agricultural clearance orders in 20 CFR 653, subpart F
and the requirements set forth in 20 CFR 655.122.  This job opportunity offers U.S. workers no less than the same benefits, wages, and
working conditions that the employer is offering, intends to offer, or will provide to H- 2A workers and complies with the requirements at 20
CFR 655, Subpart B.  The job opportunity is open to any qualified U.S. worker regardless of race, color, national origin, age, sex, religion,
handicap, or citizenship.
2. NO STRIKE, LOCKOUT, OR WORK STOPPAGE :  Employer assures that  this job opportunity, including all worksites for which the
employer is requesting H-2A labor certification does not currently have workers  on strike or being locked out in the course of a labor
dispute.  20 CFR 655.135(b).
3. HOUSING FOR WORKERS :  Employer agrees to provide for or secure housing for H- 2A workers and those workers in corresponding
employment who are not reasonably able to return to their residence at the end of the work day.  That housing complies  with the applicable
local, State, or Feder al standards and is sufficient to house the specified number of workers requested through the clearance system .  The
employer will provide the housing without charge to the worker.  Any charges for rental housing will be paid directly by the employer to the
owner or operator of the housing.  If public accommodations are provided to workers , the employer agrees to pay all housing-related
charges directly to the housing's management.  The employer agrees that charges in the form of deposits for bedding or other  similar
incidentals related to housing (e.g., utilities) must not be levied upon workers.  However, the employer may  require workers to reimburse
them for damage caused to housing by the individual worker(s) found to have been responsible for damage which is not the result of normal
wear and tear related to habitation.  When it is the prevailing practice in the area of intended employment and the occupation to provide
family housing, the employer agrees to provide family housing at no cost to workers with families who request it. 20 CFR 655.122(d),
653.501(c)(3)(vi).
Request for Conditional Access  to Intrastate or Interstate Clearance System :  Employer assures that the housing disclosed on this 
clearance order will be in full compliance with all applicable local, State, or Federal standards at least 20 calendar days before the housing 
is to be occupied. 20 CFR 653.502(a)(3).  The Certifying Officer will not certify the application until the housing has been inspected and 
approved. 
4. WORKERS’ COMPENSATION COV ERAGE :  Employer agrees to provide workers' compensation insurance coverage in compliance with
State law covering injury and disease arising out of and in the course of the worker's employment.  If the type of employment for which the
certification is sought is not covered by or is exempt from the State's workers' compensation law, the employer agrees to provide, at no cost
to the worker, insurance covering injury and disease arising out of and in the course of the worker's employment that will provide benefits at
least equal to those provided under the State workers' compensation law for other comparable employment.  20 CFR 655.122(e).
5. EMPLOYER -PROVIDED TOOLS AND EQUIPMENT :  Employer agrees to  provide to the worker, without charge or deposit charge, all
tools, supplies, and equipment required to perform the duties assigned.  20 CFR 655.122(f).
6. MEALS :  Employer agrees to provide each worker with three meals a day or furnish free and convenient cooking and kitchen facilities to the
workers that will enable the workers to prepare their own meals.  Where the employer provides the meals, the job offer will state the charge,
if any, to the worker for such meals.  The amount of meal charges is governed by 20 CFR 655.173. 20 CFR 655.122(g).
For workers engaged in the herding or production of livestock on the range, the employer agrees to provide each worker, without charge or
deposit charge, (1) either three sufficient meals a day, or free and convenient cooking facilities and adequate provision of food to enable the
worker to prepare his own meals.   To be sufficient or adequate, the meals or food provided must include a daily source of protein, vitamins,
and minerals; and (2) adequate potable water, or water that can be easily rendered potable and the means to do so.  20 CFR 655.210(e).
7. TRANSPORTATION  AND DAILY SUBSISTENCE :  Employer agrees to provide the following transportation and daily subsistence benefits
to eligible workers.  
A. Transportation to Place of Employment (Inbound)
If the worker completes 50 percent of the work contract period, and the employer did not directly provide such transportation or 
subsistence or otherwise has not yet paid the worker for such transportation or subsistence costs, the employer agrees to reimburse 
the worker for reasonable costs incurred by the worker for transportation and daily subsistence from the place from which the worker 
has come to work for the employer, whether in the U.S. or abroad to the place of employment.  The amount of the transportation 
payment must be no less (and is not required to be more) than the most economical and reasonable common carrier transportation 
charges for the distances involved.  The amount the employer will pay for daily subsistence expenses are  those amounts disclosed in 
this clearance order, which are at least as much as the employer would charge the worker for providing the worker with three meals a 
day during employment (if applicable), but in no event will less than the amount permitted under 20 CFR 655.173(a).  The employer 
understands that the F air Labor Standards Act applies independently of the H- 2A requirements and imposes obligations on employers 
regarding payment of wages. 20 CFR 655.122(h)(1). 
B. Transportation from Place of Employment (Outbound)
If the worker completes the work  contract period, or is terminated without cause, and the worker has no immediate subsequent H- 2A 
employment, the employer agrees to provide or pay for the worker's transportation and daily subsistence from the place of employment 
to the place from which the worker , disregarding intervening employment, departed to work for the employer.  Return transportation will 
not be provided to workers who voluntarily abandon employment before the end of the work contract period, or who are terminated for 
cause, if the employer follows the notification requirements in 20 CFR 655.122(n).

H-2A Case Number: ___________ _______ __      Case Status: __________________       Determination Date : ___________ __     Validity Period : ____________ _ to ___________ __ If the worker has contracted with a subsequent employer who has not agreed in such work contract to provide or pay for the worker's 
transportation and daily subsistence expenses from the employer's worksite to such subsequent employer's worksite, the employer 
must provide for such expenses.  If the worker has contracted with a subsequent employer who has agreed in such work contract to 
provide or pay for the worker's transportation and daily subsistence expenses from the employer's worksite to such subsequent 
employer's worksite, the subsequent employer must provide or pay for such expenses. 
The employer is not relieved of its obligation to provide or pay for return transportation and subsistence if an H- 2A worker is displaced 
as a result of the employer's compliance with the 50 percent rule as described in sec. 655.135(d) of this subpart with respect to the 
referrals made after the employer's date of need. 20 CFR 655.122(h)(2). 
C. Daily Transportation
Employer agrees to provide transportation between housing provided or secured by the employer and the employer’s worksite(s) at no 
cost to the worker. 20 CFR 655.122(h)(3). 
D. Compliance with Transportation Standards
Employer assures that al l employer- provided transportation will comply with all applicable Federal, State, or local laws and regulations. 
Employer agrees to provide, at a minimum, the same transportation safety standards, driver licensure, and vehicle insurance as 
required under  29 U.S.C. 1841 and 29 CFR 500.105 and 29 CFR 500.120 to 500.128.  If workers' compensation is used to cover 
transportation, in lieu of vehicle insurance, the employer will ensure that such workers' compensation covers all travel or that vehicle 
insurance exists to provide coverage for travel not covered by workers' compensation.  Employer agrees to have property damage 
insurance.  20 CFR 655.122(h)(4). 
8. THREE- FOURTHS GUARANTEE :  Employer agrees to offer the worker employment for a total number of work hours equal to at least
three- fourths of the workdays of the total period beginning with the first workday after the arrival of the worker at the place of employment or
the advertised contractual first date of need, whichever is later, and ending on the expiration date specified in the work contract or in its
extensions, if any.  20 CFR 655.122(i).
The employer may offer the worker more than the specified hours of work on a single workday.  For purposes of meeting the three -fourths 
guarantee, the worker will not be required to work for more than the number of hours specified in the job order for a workday, or on the 
worker's Sabbath or Federal holidays.  If, during the total work contract period, the employer affords the U.S. or H -2A worker less 
employment than that required under this guarantee, the employer will pay such worker the amount the worker would have earned had the 
worker, in fact, worked for the guaranteed number of days.   An employer will not be considered to have met the work guarantee if the 
empl oyer has merely offered work on three -fourths of the workdays if each workday did not consist of a full number of hours of work time as 
specified in the job order.  All hours of work actually performed may be counted by the employer in calculating whether the period of 
guaranteed employment has been met.  Any hours the worker fails to work, up to a maximum of the number of hours specified in the job 
order for a workday, when the worker has been offered an opportunity to work, and all hours of work actually performed (including voluntary 
work over 8 hours in a workday or on the worker's Sabbath or Federal holidays), may be counted by the employer in calculating whether the 
period of guaranteed employment has been met.  20 CFR 655.122(i). 
If the worker is paid on a piece rate basis, the employer agrees to use the worker's average hourly piece rate earnings or the required 
hourly wage rate, whichever is higher, to calculate the amount due under the three-fourths guarantee.  20 CFR 655.122(i). 
If the worker voluntarily abandons employment before the end of the period of employment set forth in the job order, or is terminated for 
cause, and the employer follows the notification requirements in 20 CFR 655.122(n), the worker is not entitled to the three-fourths 
guarantee.  The employer is not liable for payment of the three- fourths guarantee to an H- 2A worker whom the Department of Labor 
certifies is displaced due to the employer's requirement to hire qualified and available U.S. workers during the recruitment period set out in 
20 CPR 655.135(d), which lasts until 50 percent of the period of the work contract has elapsed (50 percent rule).  20 CFR 655.122(i). 
Important Note:  In circumstances where the work contract is terminated due to contract impossibility  under 20 CFR 655.122(o), the three-
fourths guarantee period ends on the date of termination.   
9. EARNINGS RECORDS :  Employer agrees to keep accurate and adequate records with respect to the workers' earnings at the place or
places of employment, or at one or more  established central recordkeeping offices where such records are customarily maintained.  All
records must be available for inspection and transcription by the Department of Labor or a duly authorized and designated representative,
and by the worker and representatives designated by the worker as evidenced by appropriate documentation.  Where the records are
maintained at a central recordkeeping office, other than in the place or places of employment, such records must be made available for
inspection and copying within 72 hours following notice from the Department of Labor, or a duly authorized and designated representative,
and by the worker and designated representatives.  The content of earnings records must meet all regulatory requirements and be retai ned
by the employer for a period of not less than 3 years after the date of certification by the Department of Labor.  20 CFR 655.122(j).
10. HOURS AND EARNINGS STATEMENTS:  Employer agrees to furnish to the worker on or before each payday in one or more written
statements the following information: (1) the worker's total earnings for the pay period; (2) the worker's hourly rate and/or piece rate of pay;
(3)the hours of employment offered to the worker (showing offers in accordance with the three- fourths guarantee as determined in 20 CFR
655.122(i), separate from any hours offered over and above the guarantee); (4) the hours actually worked by the worker; (5) an itemization
of all deductions made from the worker's wages; (6) If piece rates are used, the units produced daily; (7) beginning and ending dates of the
pay period; and (8) the employer's name, address and FEIN.  20 CFR 655.122(k).
For workers engaged in the herding or production of livestock on the range, the employer is exempt from recording and furnishing the hours 
actually worked each day, the time the worker begins and ends each workday, as well as the nature and amount of work performe d, but 
otherwise must comply with the earnings records and hours and earnings statement requirements set out in 20 CFR 655.122(j) and (k) .  
The employer agrees to keep daily records indicating whether the site of the employee's work was on the range or off the range.  If the 
employer prorates a worker's wage because of the worker's voluntary absence for personal reasons, it must also keep a record of the 
reason for the worker's absence. 20 CFR 655.210(f).

H-2A Case Number: ___________ _______ __      Case Status: __________________       Determination Date : ___________ __     Validity Period : ____________ _ to ___________ __ 11. RATES OF PAY:  The employer agrees that it will offer, advertise in its recruitment, and pay at least the Adverse Effect Wage Rate
(AEWR), the prevailing hourly wage rate, the prevailing piece rate, the agreed- upon collective bargaining rate, or the Federal or State
minimum wage rate, in effect at the time work is performed, whichever is highest.  If the worker is paid by the hour, the employer must pay
this rate for every hour or portion thereof worked during a pay period.  If the offered wage(s) disclosed in this clearance order  is/are based
on commission, bonuses, or other incentives, the employer guarantees the wage paid on a weekly, semi -monthly, or monthly basis  will
equal or exceed the AEWR, prevailing hourly wage or piece rate, the legal Federal or State minimum wage, or any agreed -upon collective
bargaining rate, whichever is highest.
If the worker is paid on a piece rate basis and at the end of the pay period the piece rate does not result in average hourly piece rate
earnings during the pay period at least equal to the amount the worker would have earned had the worker been paid at the appr opriate
hourly rate of pay, the employer agrees to supplement the worker's pay at that time so that the worker's earnings are at least as much as
the worker would have earned during the pay period if the worker had instead been paid at the appropriate hourly wage rate for each hour
worked.  20 CFR 655.120, 655.122(l).
For workers engaged in the herding or production of livestock on the range, the employer agrees to pay the worker at least the monthly 
AEWR, the agreed-upon collective bargaining wage, or the applicable minimum wage imposed by Federal or State law or judicial action, in 
effect at the time work is performed, whichever is highest, for every month of the job order period or portion thereof.  If the offered wage 
disclosed in this clearance order is  based on commissions, bonuses, or other incentives, the employer as sures that the wage paid will equal 
or exceed the monthly AEWR, the agreed -upon collective bargaining wage, or the applicable minimum wage imposed by Federal or State 
law or judicial action, whichever is highest, and will be paid to each worker free and clear without any unauthorized deductions.  The 
employer may prorate the wage for the initial and final pay periods of the job order period if its pay period does not match the beginning or 
ending dates of the job order.   The employer also may prorate the wage if an employee is voluntarily unavailable to work for personal 
reasons.  20 CFR 655.210(g). 
12. FREQUENCY OF PAY :  Employer agrees to pay workers when due based on the frequency disclosed in this clearance order.  20 CFR
655.122(m). 
13. ABANDONMENT OF EMPLOYM ENT OR TERMINATION FOR CAUSE :  If a worker voluntarily abandons employment before the end of
the contract period, or is terminated for cause, employer is not responsible for providing or paying for the subsequent transportation and
subsistence expenses of that worker, and that worker is not entitled to the three- fourths guarantee, if the employer notifies the Department
of Labor and, if applicable, the Department of Homeland Security, in writing or by any other method specified by the Department of Labor or
the Department of Homeland Security in the Federal Register, not later than 2 working days after the abandonment or termination occurs.
A worker  will be deemed to have abandoned the work contract if the worker  fails to show up for work at the regularly s cheduled time and
place for 5 consecutive work days without the consent of the employer.  20 CFR 655.122(n).
14. CONTRACT IMPOSSIBILITY : The work contract may be terminated before the end date of work specified in the work contract if
the services of the workers are no longer required for reasons beyond the control of the employer due to fire, weather, or other Act of God
that makes fulfillment of the contract impossible, as determined by the U.S. Department of Labor.  In the event that the work contract is
terminated, the employer agrees to fulfill  the three-fourths guarantee for the time that has elapsed from the start date of work specified in
the work contract to the date of termination.  The employer also agrees that it will make efforts to transfer the worker to other comparable
employment acceptable to the worker and consistent with existing immigration laws.  In situations where a transfer is not affected, the
employer agrees to return the worker at the employer’s expense to the place from which the worker, disregarding intervening employment,
came to work for the employer , or transport the worker to his/her next certified H -2A employer, whichever the worker prefers.  The employer
will also reimburse the worker the full amount of any deductions made by the employer from the worker’s pay for transportation and
subsistence expenses to the place of employment .  The employer will also pay the worker for any transportation and subsistence expenses
incurred by the worker to that employer’s place of employment.  The amounts the employer will pay for subsistence expenses per day are
those amounts disclosed in this  clearance order .  The amount of the transportation payment must not be less (and is not required to be
more) than the most economical and reasonable common carrier transportation charges for the distances involved. 20 CFR 655.122(o).
The employer is not required to pay for transportation and daily subsistence from the place of employment to a subsequent employer’s 
worksite  if the worker has contracted with a subsequent employer who has agreed to provide or pay for the worker’s transportation and 
subsistence expenses from the present employer’s worksite to the subsequent employer’s worksite.   20 CFR 655.122(h)(2). 
15. DEDUCTIONS FROM WORKER’S PAY : Employer a grees to make all deductions from the worker’s paycheck required by law.  This  job
offer discloses all deductions not required by law which the employer will make from  the worker’s paycheck and all such deductions are
reasonable, in accordance with 20 CFR 655.122(p) and 29 CFR part 531.  The wage requirements of 20 CFR 655.120 will not be met
where undisclosed or unauthorized deductions, rebates, or refunds reduce the wage payment made to the employee below the minimum
amounts required under 20 CFR part 655, subpart B, or where the employee fails to receive such amounts free and clear because the
employee kicks back directly or indirectly to the employer or to another person for the employer’s benefit the whole or part of the wage
delivered to the employee.  20 CFR 655.122(p).
16. DISCLOSURE OF WORK CONTRACT : Employer agrees to provide a copy of the work contract to an H- 2A worker no later than the time at
which the worker applies for the visa, or to a worker in corresponding employment no later than on the day work commences.  For an H-2A
worker coming to the employer from another H- 2A employer, the employer agrees to provide a copy of the work contract no later than the
time an offer of employment is made to the H -2A worker.  A copy of the work contract will be provided to each worker in a language
understood by the worker, as necessary or reasonable.  In the absence of a separate, written work contract entered into between the
employer and the worker, the required terms of this clearance order , including all Addendums, and the certified H-2A Application for
Temporary Employment Certification will be the work contract. 20 CFR 655.122(q).

If the worker completes 50 percent of the work contract period, and the employer did not directly provide such transportation or 
subsistence or otherwise has not yet paid  the worker for such transportation or subsistence costs, the employer agrees to reimburse the 
worker for reasonable costs incurred by the worker for transportation and daily subsistence from the place from which the worker came 
to work for the employer to  the employer’s place of employment, whether in the U.S. or abroad.  The amount of the transportation 
payment must be no less (and is not required to be more) than the most economical and reasonable common carrier transportation 
charges for the distances involved.  The amount the employer will pay for daily subsistence expenses are those amounts disclosed in 
this clearance order , which  are at least as much as the employer would charge the worker for providing the worker with three meals a 
day during employment (if applicable), but in no event will be less than the amount permitted under 20 CFR 655.173(a).   The employer 
understands that the F air Labor Standards Act  applies independently of the H -2A requirements and imposes obligations on employers 
regarding payment of wages.  20 CFR 655.122(h)(1).  
B. Transportation from Place of Employment (Outbound)
If the worker completes the work contract period , or is terminated without cause, and the worker has no immediate subsequent H -2A 
employment, the employer agrees to provide or pay for the worker's transportation and daily subsistence from the place of employment 
to the place from which the worker, disregarding intervening employment,  departed to work for the employer.  Return transportation will 
not be provided to workers who voluntarily abandon employment before the end of the work contract period, or who are terminated for cause , if the employer follows the notification requirements in 20 CFR 655.122(n) . 
If the worker has contracted with a subsequent employer who has not agreed in such work contract to provide or pay for the worker's 
transportation and daily subsistence expenses from the employer's place of employment  to such subsequent employer's place of 
employment , the employer must provide for such expenses.  If the worker has contracted with a subsequent employer who has agreed 
in such work contract to provide or pay for the worker's transportation and daily subsistence expenses from the employer's place of 
employment  to such subsequent employer's place of employment, the subsequent employer must provide or pay for such expenses. 
The employer is not relieved of its obligation to provide or pay for return transportation and subsistence if an H -2A worker is displa ced 
as a result of the employer's compliance with the employer’s obligation to hire U.S. workers who apply or are referred after the employer’s 
date of need during the recruitment period set out  in 20 CFR  655.135(d) . 20 CFR 655.122(h)(2).  
C. Daily Transportation
Employer agrees to provide transportation between housing provided or secured by the employer and the employer’s place (s) of 
employment  at no cost to the worker. 20 CFR 655.122(h)(3).  
D. Compliance with Transportation Standards
Employer assures that all employer -provided transportation will comply with all applicable Federal, State, or local laws and regulations.
Employer agrees to provide, at a minimum, the same transportation safety standards, driver licensure, and vehicle insurance as required 
under 29 U.S.C. 1841 and 29 CFR 500.104 or 500.105 and 29 CFR 500.120 to 500.128.  If workers' compensation is used to cover
transportation, in lieu of vehicle insurance, the employer will ensure that such workers' compensation covers all travel or that vehicle
insurance exists to provide coverage for travel not covered by workers' compensation.  Employer agrees to have property damage
insurance.  20 CFR 655.122(h)(4).
8. THREE -FOURTHS GUARANTEE :  Employer agrees to offer the worker employment for a total number of work hours equal to at least three-
fourths of the workdays of the total period beginning with the first workday after the arrival of the worker at the place of employment or t he
advertised contractual first date of need, whichever is later, and ending on the expiration date specified in the work contract or in its extensions, 
if any.  20 CFR 655.122(i).
The employer may offer the worker more than the specified hours of work on a single workday.  For purposes of meeting the three- fourths 
guarantee, the worker will not be required to work for more than the number of hours specified in the job order for a workday, or on the 
worker's Sabbath or Federal holidays.  If , during the total work contract period, the employer affords the U.S. or H -2A worker less employment 
than that required under this guarantee, the employer will pay such worker the amount the worker would have earned had the worker, in fact, 
worked for the guaranteed number of days.   An employer will not  be considered to have met the work guarantee if the employer has merely 
offered work on three- fourths of the workdays if each workday did not consist of a full number of hours of work time as specified in the job 
order.  All hours of work actually performed may be counted by the employer in calculating whether the period of guaranteed employment 
has been met.  Any hours the worker fails to work, up to a maximum of the number of hours specified in the job order for a workday, when 
the worker has been offered an opportunity to work, and all hours of work actually performed (including voluntary work over 8 hours in a 
workday or on the worker's Sabbath or Federal holidays), may be counted by the employer in calculating whether the period of guaranteed 
employment has been met.  20 CFR 655.122(i).  
If the worker is paid on a piece rate basis, the employer agrees to use the worker's average hourly piece rate earnings or the required hourly 
wage rate, whichever is higher, to calculate the amount due under the three-fourths guarantee.  20 CFR 655.122(i).

H-2A Case Number: __________________ __       Case  Status: __________________       Determination Date : _____________    Validity Period : _____________ to _____________
If the worker voluntarily abandons employment before the end of the period of employment set forth in the job order, or is terminated for 
cause, and the employer follows the notification requirements in 20 CFR 655.122(n), the worker is not entitled to the three- fourths guarantee. 
The employer is not liable for payment of the three- fourths guarantee to an H- 2A worker whom the Department of Labor certifies is displaced 
due to the employer's requirement to hire qualified and available U.S. workers during the recruitment period set out in 20 CFR 655.135(d) , 
which lasts until 50 percent of the period of the work contract has elapsed (50 percent rule).  20 CFR 655.122(i).  
Important Note:  In circumstances where the work contract is terminated due to contract impossibility  under 20 CFR 655.122(o), the three-
fourths guarantee period ends on the date of termination.   
9. EARNINGS RECORDS :  Employer agrees to keep accurate and adequate records with respect to the workers' earnings at the place or places 
of employment, or at one or more established central recordkeeping offices where such records are customarily maintained.  T he records
must in clude each worker’s permanent address, and, when available, permanent email address, and phone number(s) .  All records must be
available for inspection and transcription by the Department of Labor or a duly authorized and designated representative, and by the worker
and representatives designated by the worker as evidenced by appropriate documentation.   Where the records are maintained at a central
recordkeeping office, other than in the place or places of employment, such records must be made available for  inspection and copying within 
72 hours following notice from the Department of Labor, or a duly authorized and designated representative, and by the worker  and designated 
representatives.  The content of earnings records must  meet all regulatory requirements and be retained by the employer for a period of not
less than 3 years after the date of certification by the Department of Labor.  20 CFR 655.122(j).
10. HOURS AND EARNINGS STATEMENTS :  Employer agrees to furnish to the worker on or before each payday in one or more written
statements the following information: (1) the worker's total earnings for the pay period; (2) the worker's hourly rate and/or piece rate of pay;
(3)the hours of employment offered to the worker (showing offers in accordance with the three- fourths guarantee as determined in 20 CFR
655.122(i), separate from any hours offered over and above the guarantee); (4) the hours actually worked by the worker; (5) a n itemization of
all deductions made from the worker's wages; (6) if piece rates are used, the units produced daily; (7) b eginning and ending dates of the pay
period; and (8) t he employer's name, address and FEIN.  20 CFR 655.122(k).
For workers engaged in the herding or  production of livestock on the range, the employer is exempt from recording and furnishing the hours 
actually worked each day, the time the worker begins and ends each workday, as well as the nature and amount of work performed , but 
otherwise must comply with the earnings records and hours and earnings statement requirements set out in 20 CFR 655.122(j) and (k) .  The 
employer agrees to keep daily records indicating whether the site of the employee's work was on the range or off the range.   If the em ployer 
prorates a worker's wage because of the worker's voluntary absence for personal reasons, it must also keep a record of the reason for the 
worker's absence.  20 CFR 655.210(f).  
11. RATES OF PAY:  The employer agrees that it will offer, advertise in its recruitment, and pay at least the Adverse Effect Wage Rate (AEWR),
a prevailing wage rate, the agreed-u pon collective bargaining rate, the Federal m inimum  wage, or the State minimum wage, whichever is
highest, for every hour or portion thereof worked during a pay period.  If the offered wage(s) disclosed in this clearance order is/are based on
commission, bonus es, or other
 incentives, the employer guarantees the wage paid on a weekly, semi-m onthly, or monthly basis will equal or
exceed the AEWR,
 prevailing wage rate, Federal minimum wage, State minimum wage, or any agreed-upon collective bargaining rate,
whichever is highest.  If the applicable AEWR or prevailing wage is adjusted during the contract period, and that new rate is higher than the
highest of the AEWR, 
the prevailing wage, the collective bargaining rate, the Federal minimum wage, or the State minimum wage, the
employer will increase the pay of all employees  in the same occupation to the higher rate no later than the effective date of the
adjustment.  If t
he new AEWR or prevailing wage is lower than the rate guaranteed on this job order, the employer will continue to pay at least
the rate guaranteed on
 this job order.
If the worker is paid on a piece rate basis, the piec e rate must be no less than the prevailing piece rate for the crop activity or agricultural
activity and, if applicable, a distinct work task or tasks performed in that activ ity in the geographic area, if one has been issued.  At the end of
the pay  period, if the piece rate does not result in average hourly pi ece rate earnings during the pay period at least equal to the a
mount the
worker would have earned had the worker been paid at the appropriate hourly rate, the employer agrees to supplement the worker's pay at that
time so that the worker's earnings are at least as much as the worker would have earned during the pay period if the worker had instead been
paid at the appropriate hourly wage rate for each hour worked. 
 20 CFR 655.120, 655.122(l).
For workers engaged in the herding or production of livestock on the range, the employer agrees to pay the worker at least the monthly
AEWR, the agreed-upon collective bargaining wage, or the applicable minimum wage imposed by
 Federal or State law or judicial action, in
effect at the time work is performed, whichever is highest, for every month of the job order period or portion thereof.  If the offered wage
disclosed in this clearance order is based on commissions, bonuses, or other incentives, the employer guarantees that the wage paid will
equal or exceed the monthly AEWR, the agreed-upon collective ba rgaining wage, or the applic
able minimum wage imposed by Federal or
State law or judicial action, whichever is highest, and will be paid to each worker free and clear without any
 unauthorized deductions.  The
employer may prorate the wage for the initial and final pay periods of the job order period if its pay period does not match the beginning or
ending dates of the job order.  The employer also may prorate the wage if an employee is voluntarily unavailable to work for personal
reasons. 20 CFR 655.210(g).
12.FREQUENCY O F P
AY:  Employer agrees to pay workers when due based on the frequency disclosed in this clearance order. 20 CFR 655.122(m).
13. ABANDONMENT OF EMPLOYMENT OR TERMINATION FOR CAUSE :  If a worker voluntarily abandons employment before the end of the
contract period, or is terminated for cause, the employer is not responsible for providing or paying for the subsequent transportation and
subsistence expenses of that worker, and that worker is not entitled to the three-fourths guarantee, if the employer notifies  the U.S. Department
of Labor and, if applicable, the Department of Homeland Security, in writing or by any other method specified by the Department of Labor or
the Department of Homeland Security in the Federal Register, not later than 2 working days after the abandonment or termination occurs .  A
worker will be deemed to have abandoned the work contr act after the worker fails to show up for work at the regularly scheduled time for 5
consecutive work days  without the consent of the employer.  20 CFR 655.122(n).
14. CONTRACT IMPOSSIBILITY :  The work contract may be terminated before the end date of work specified in the work contract if the services 
of the workers are no longer required for reasons beyond the control of the employer due to fire, weather, or other Act of God that makes
fulfillment of the contract impossible, as determined by the Department of Labor.  In the event that the work contract is terminated, the
employer agrees to fulfill  the three -fourths guarantee for the time that has elapsed from the start date of work specified in  the work contract
to the date of termination.  The employer also agrees  that it will make efforts to transfer the worker to other comparable employment acceptable

to the worker and consistent with existing immigration laws.   In situations where a transfer  is not affected, the employer agrees to  return the 
worker at the employer’s expense to the place from which the worker, disregarding intervening employment, came to work for the employer , 
or transport the worker to his/her next certified H -2A employer, whichever the worker prefers.  The employer will also reimburse the worker 
the full amount of any deductions made by the employer from the worker’s pay for transportation and subsistence expenses to the place of 
employment .  The employer will also pay the worker for any transportation and subsistence expenses incurred by the worker to that employer’s 
place of employment.   The amounts the employer will pay for subsistence expenses per day are  those amounts disclosed in this  clearance 
order.  The amount of the transportation payment must not be less (and is not required to be more) than the most economical and reasonable 
common carrier transportation charges for the distances involved.  20 CFR 655.122(o).

15. DEDUCTIONS FROM WORKER’S PAY:  Employer agrees to make all deductions from the worker’s paycheck required by law.  This job
offer discloses all deductions not required by law which the employer will make from  the worker’s paycheck and all such deductions are
reasonable, in accordance with 20 CFR 655.122(p)  and 29 CFR p art 531.  The wage requirements of 20 CFR 655.120 will not be met where
undisclosed or unauthorized deductions, rebates, or refunds reduce the wage payment made to the employee below the minimum amounts
required under 20 CFR p art 655, subpart B, or where the employee fails to receive such amounts free and clear because the employee kicks 
back directly or indirectly to the employer or to another person for the employer’s benefit the whole or part of the wage del ivered to the
employee.  20 CFR 655.122(p).
16. DISCLOSURE OF WORK CONTRACT :  Employer agrees to provide a copy of the work contract to an H- 2A worker no later than the time at

to provide a copy of the work contract no later than the time an offer of employment is made to the H -2A worker.  A copy of the work contract
will be provided to each worker in a language understood by the worker, as necessary or reasonable.  In the absence of a separate, written
work contract entered into between the employer and the worker, the work contract at minimum will be the terms of this clearance order ,
including all Addenda, the certified H-2A Application for Temporary Employment Certification and any obligations required under 8 U.S.C.
1188, 29 CFR part 501, or 20 CFR part 655, subpart B .  20 CFR 655.122(q).

H-2A Case Number: ___________ _______ __      Case Status: __________________       Determination Date : ___________ __     Validity Period : ____________ _ to ___________ __ I. Conditions of Employment and Assurance s for H-2A Agricultural Clearance Orders
By virtue of my signature below, I HEREBY CERTIFY  my knowledge of and compliance with applicable Federal, State, and local employment-
related laws and regulations, including employment-related health and safety laws, and certify the following conditions of employment: 
1. JOB OPPORTUNITY :  Employer assures that the job opportunity identified in this clearance order (hereinafter also referred to as the “job
order”) is a full -time temporary position being placed with the SWA in connection with an H-2A Application for Temporary Employment
Certification for H- 2A workers and this clearance order satisfies the requirements for agricultural clearance orders in 20 CFR 653, subpart F
and the requirements set forth in 20 CFR 655.122.  This job opportunity offers U.S. workers no less than the same benefits, wages, and
working conditions that the employer is offering, intends to offer, or will provide to H- 2A workers and complies with the requirements at 20
CFR 655, Subpart B.  The job opportunity is open to any qualified U.S. worker regardless of race, color, national origin, age, sex, religion,
handicap, or citizenship.
2. NO STRIKE, LOCKOUT, OR WORK STOPPAGE :  Employer assures that  this job opportunity, including all worksites for which the
employer is requesting H-2A labor certification does not currently have workers  on strike or being locked out in the course of a labor
dispute.  20 CFR 655.135(b).
3. HOUSING FOR WORKERS :  Employer agrees to provide for or secure housing for H- 2A workers and those workers in corresponding
employment who are not reasonably able to return to their residence at the end of the work day.  That housing complies  with the applicable
local, State, or Feder al standards and is sufficient to house the specified number of workers requested through the clearance system .  The
employer will provide the housing without charge to the worker.  Any charges for rental housing will be paid directly by the employer to the
owner or operator of the housing.  If public accommodations are provided to workers , the employer agrees to pay all housing-related
charges directly to the housing's management.  The employer agrees that charges in the form of deposits for bedding or other  similar
incidentals related to housing (e.g., utilities) must not be levied upon workers.  However, the employer may  require workers to reimburse
them for damage caused to housing by the individual worker(s) found to have been responsible for damage which is not the result of normal
wear and tear related to habitation.  When it is the prevailing practice in the area of intended employment and the occupation to provide
family housing, the employer agrees to provide family housing at no cost to workers with families who request it. 20 CFR 655.122(d),
653.501(c)(3)(vi).
Request for Conditional Access  to Intrastate or Interstate Clearance System :  Employer assures that the housing disclosed on this 
clearance order will be in full compliance with all applicable local, State, or Federal standards at least 20 calendar days before the housing 
is to be occupied. 20 CFR 653.502(a)(3).  The Certifying Officer will not certify the application until the housing has been inspected and 
approved. 
4. WORKERS’ COMPENSATION COV ERAGE :  Employer agrees to provide workers' compensation insurance coverage in compliance with
State law covering injury and disease arising out of and in the course of the worker's employment.  If the type of employment for which the
certification is sought is not covered by or is exempt from the State's workers' compensation law, the employer agrees to provide, at no cost
to the worker, insurance covering injury and disease arising out of and in the course of the worker's employment that will provide benefits at
least equal to those provided under the State workers' compensation law for other comparable employment.  20 CFR 655.122(e).
5. EMPLOYER -PROVIDED TOOLS AND EQUIPMENT :  Employer agrees to  provide to the worker, without charge or deposit charge, all
tools, supplies, and equipment required to perform the duties assigned.  20 CFR 655.122(f).
6. MEALS :  Employer agrees to provide each worker with three meals a day or furnish free and convenient cooking and kitchen facilities to the
workers that will enable the workers to prepare their own meals.  Where the employer provides the meals, the job offer will state the charge,
if any, to the worker for such meals.  The amount of meal charges is governed by 20 CFR 655.173. 20 CFR 655.122(g).
For workers engaged in the herding or production of livestock on the range, the employer agrees to provide each worker, without charge or
deposit charge, (1) either three sufficient meals a day, or free and convenient cooking facilities and adequate provision of food to enable the
worker to prepare his own meals.   To be sufficient or adequate, the meals or food provided must include a daily source of protein, vitamins,
and minerals; and (2) adequate potable water, or water that can be easily rendered potable and the means to do so.  20 CFR 655.210(e).
7. TRANSPORTATION  AND DAILY SUBSISTENCE :  Employer agrees to provide the following transportation and daily subsistence benefits
to eligible workers.  
A. Transportation to Place of Employment (Inbound)
If the worker completes 50 percent of the work contract period, and the employer did not directly provide such transportation or 
subsistence or otherwise has not yet paid the worker for such transportation or subsistence costs, the employer agrees to reimburse 
the worker for reasonable costs incurred by the worker for transportation and daily subsistence from the place from which the worker 
has come to work for the employer, whether in the U.S. or abroad to the place of employment.  The amount of the transportation 
payment must be no less (and is not required to be more) than the most economical and reasonable common carrier transportation 
charges for the distances involved.  The amount the employer will pay for daily subsistence expenses are  those amounts disclosed in 
this clearance order, which are at least as much as the employer would charge the worker for providing the worker with three meals a 
day during employment (if applicable), but in no event will less than the amount permitted under 20 CFR 655.173(a).  The employer 
understands that the F air Labor Standards Act applies independently of the H- 2A requirements and imposes obligations on employers 
regarding payment of wages. 20 CFR 655.122(h)(1). 
B. Transportation from Place of Employment (Outbound)
If the worker completes the work  contract period, or is terminated without cause, and the worker has no immediate subsequent H- 2A 
employment, the employer agrees to provide or pay for the worker's transportation and daily subsistence from the place of employment 
to the place from which the worker , disregarding intervening employment, departed to work for the employer.  Return transportation will 
not be provided to workers who voluntarily abandon employment before the end of the work contract period, or who are terminated for 
cause, if the employer follows the notification requirements in 20 CFR 655.122(n).

H-2A Case Number: ___________ _______ __      Case Status: __________________       Determination Date : ___________ __     Validity Period : ____________ _ to ___________ __ If the worker has contracted with a subsequent employer who has not agreed in such work contract to provide or pay for the worker's 
transportation and daily subsistence expenses from the employer's worksite to such subsequent employer's worksite, the employer 
must provide for such expenses.  If the worker has contracted with a subsequent employer who has agreed in such work contract to 
provide or pay for the worker's transportation and daily subsistence expenses from the employer's worksite to such subsequent 
employer's worksite, the subsequent employer must provide or pay for such expenses. 
The employer is not relieved of its obligation to provide or pay for return transportation and subsistence if an H- 2A worker is displaced 
as a result of the employer's compliance with the 50 percent rule as described in sec. 655.135(d) of this subpart with respect to the 
referrals made after the employer's date of need. 20 CFR 655.122(h)(2). 
C. Daily Transportation
Employer agrees to provide transportation between housing provided or secured by the employer and the employer’s worksite(s) at no 
cost to the worker. 20 CFR 655.122(h)(3). 
D. Compliance with Transportation Standards
Employer assures that al l employer- provided transportation will comply with all applicable Federal, State, or local laws and regulations. 
Employer agrees to provide, at a minimum, the same transportation safety standards, driver licensure, and vehicle insurance as 
required under  29 U.S.C. 1841 and 29 CFR 500.105 and 29 CFR 500.120 to 500.128.  If workers' compensation is used to cover 
transportation, in lieu of vehicle insurance, the employer will ensure that such workers' compensation covers all travel or that vehicle 
insurance exists to provide coverage for travel not covered by workers' compensation.  Employer agrees to have property damage 
insurance.  20 CFR 655.122(h)(4). 
8. THREE- FOURTHS GUARANTEE :  Employer agrees to offer the worker employment for a total number of work hours equal to at least
three- fourths of the workdays of the total period beginning with the first workday after the arrival of the worker at the place of employment or
the advertised contractual first date of need, whichever is later, and ending on the expiration date specified in the work contract or in its
extensions, if any.  20 CFR 655.122(i).
The employer may offer the worker more than the specified hours of work on a single workday.  For purposes of meeting the three -fourths 
guarantee, the worker will not be required to work for more than the number of hours specified in the job order for a workday, or on the 
worker's Sabbath or Federal holidays.  If, during the total work contract period, the employer affords the U.S. or H -2A worker less 
employment than that required under this guarantee, the employer will pay such worker the amount the worker would have earned had the 
worker, in fact, worked for the guaranteed number of days.   An employer will not be considered to have met the work guarantee if the 
empl oyer has merely offered work on three -fourths of the workdays if each workday did not consist of a full number of hours of work time as 
specified in the job order.  All hours of work actually performed may be counted by the employer in calculating whether the period of 
guaranteed employment has been met.  Any hours the worker fails to work, up to a maximum of the number of hours specified in the job 
order for a workday, when the worker has been offered an opportunity to work, and all hours of work actually performed (including voluntary 
work over 8 hours in a workday or on the worker's Sabbath or Federal holidays), may be counted by the employer in calculating whether the 
period of guaranteed employment has been met.  20 CFR 655.122(i). 
If the worker is paid on a piece rate basis, the employer agrees to use the worker's average hourly piece rate earnings or the required 
hourly wage rate, whichever is higher, to calculate the amount due under the three-fourths guarantee.  20 CFR 655.122(i). 
If the worker voluntarily abandons employment before the end of the period of employment set forth in the job order, or is terminated for 
cause, and the employer follows the notification requirements in 20 CFR 655.122(n), the worker is not entitled to the three-fourths 
guarantee.  The employer is not liable for payment of the three- fourths guarantee to an H- 2A worker whom the Department of Labor 
certifies is displaced due to the employer's requirement to hire qualified and available U.S. workers during the recruitment period set out in 
20 CPR 655.135(d), which lasts until 50 percent of the period of the work contract has elapsed (50 percent rule).  20 CFR 655.122(i). 
Important Note:  In circumstances where the work contract is terminated due to contract impossibility  under 20 CFR 655.122(o), the three-
fourths guarantee period ends on the date of termination.   
9. EARNINGS RECORDS :  Employer agrees to keep accurate and adequate records with respect to the workers' earnings at the place or
places of employment, or at one or more  established central recordkeeping offices where such records are customarily maintained.  All
records must be available for inspection and transcription by the Department of Labor or a duly authorized and designated representative,
and by the worker and representatives designated by the worker as evidenced by appropriate documentation.  Where the records are
maintained at a central recordkeeping office, other than in the place or places of employment, such records must be made available for
inspection and copying within 72 hours following notice from the Department of Labor, or a duly authorized and designated representative,
and by the worker and designated representatives.  The content of earnings records must meet all regulatory requirements and be retai ned
by the employer for a period of not less than 3 years after the date of certification by the Department of Labor.  20 CFR 655.122(j).
10. HOURS AND EARNINGS STATEMENTS:  Employer agrees to furnish to the worker on or before each payday in one or more written
statements the following information: (1) the worker's total earnings for the pay period; (2) the worker's hourly rate and/or piece rate of pay;
(3)the hours of employment offered to the worker (showing offers in accordance with the three- fourths guarantee as determined in 20 CFR
655.122(i), separate from any hours offered over and above the guarantee); (4) the hours actually worked by the worker; (5) an itemization
of all deductions made from the worker's wages; (6) If piece rates are used, the units produced daily; (7) beginning and ending dates of the
pay period; and (8) the employer's name, address and FEIN.  20 CFR 655.122(k).
For workers engaged in the herding or production of livestock on the range, the employer is exempt from recording and furnishing the hours 
actually worked each day, the time the worker begins and ends each workday, as well as the nature and amount of work performe d, but 
otherwise must comply with the earnings records and hours and earnings statement requirements set out in 20 CFR 655.122(j) and (k) .  
The employer agrees to keep daily records indicating whether the site of the employee's work was on the range or off the range.  If the 
employer prorates a worker's wage because of the worker's voluntary absence for personal reasons, it must also keep a record of the 
reason for the worker's absence. 20 CFR 655.210(f).

H-2A Case Number: ___________ _______ __      Case Status: __________________       Determination Date : ___________ __     Validity Period : ____________ _ to ___________ __ 11. RATES OF PAY:  The employer agrees that it will offer, advertise in its recruitment, and pay at least the Adverse Effect Wage Rate
(AEWR), the prevailing hourly wage rate, the prevailing piece rate, the agreed- upon collective bargaining rate, or the Federal or State
minimum wage rate, in effect at the time work is performed, whichever is highest.  If the worker is paid by the hour, the employer must pay
this rate for every hour or portion thereof worked during a pay period.  If the offered wage(s) disclosed in this clearance order  is/are based
on commission, bonuses, or other incentives, the employer guarantees the wage paid on a weekly, semi -monthly, or monthly basis  will
equal or exceed the AEWR, prevailing hourly wage or piece rate, the legal Federal or State minimum wage, or any agreed -upon collective
bargaining rate, whichever is highest.
If the worker is paid on a piece rate basis and at the end of the pay period the piece rate does not result in average hourly piece rate
earnings during the pay period at least equal to the amount the worker would have earned had the worker been paid at the appr opriate
hourly rate of pay, the employer agrees to supplement the worker's pay at that time so that the worker's earnings are at least as much as
the worker would have earned during the pay period if the worker had instead been paid at the appropriate hourly wage rate for each hour
worked.  20 CFR 655.120, 655.122(l).
For workers engaged in the herding or production of livestock on the range, the employer agrees to pay the worker at least the monthly 
AEWR, the agreed-upon collective bargaining wage, or the applicable minimum wage imposed by Federal or State law or judicial action, in 
effect at the time work is performed, whichever is highest, for every month of the job order period or portion thereof.  If the offered wage 
disclosed in this clearance order is  based on commissions, bonuses, or other incentives, the employer as sures that the wage paid will equal 
or exceed the monthly AEWR, the agreed -upon collective bargaining wage, or the applicable minimum wage imposed by Federal or State 
law or judicial action, whichever is highest, and will be paid to each worker free and clear without any unauthorized deductions.  The 
employer may prorate the wage for the initial and final pay periods of the job order period if its pay period does not match the beginning or 
ending dates of the job order.   The employer also may prorate the wage if an employee is voluntarily unavailable to work for personal 
reasons.  20 CFR 655.210(g). 
12. FREQUENCY OF PAY :  Employer agrees to pay workers when due based on the frequency disclosed in this clearance order.  20 CFR
655.122(m). 
13. ABANDONMENT OF EMPLOYM ENT OR TERMINATION FOR CAUSE :  If a worker voluntarily abandons employment before the end of
the contract period, or is terminated for cause, employer is not responsible for providing or paying for the subsequent transportation and
subsistence expenses of that worker, and that worker is not entitled to the three- fourths guarantee, if the employer notifies the Department
of Labor and, if applicable, the Department of Homeland Security, in writing or by any other method specified by the Department of Labor or
the Department of Homeland Security in the Federal Register, not later than 2 working days after the abandonment or termination occurs.
A worker  will be deemed to have abandoned the work contract if the worker  fails to show up for work at the regularly s cheduled time and
place for 5 consecutive work days without the consent of the employer.  20 CFR 655.122(n).
14. CONTRACT IMPOSSIBILITY : The work contract may be terminated before the end date of work specified in the work contract if
the services of the workers are no longer required for reasons beyond the control of the employer due to fire, weather, or other Act of God
that makes fulfillment of the contract impossible, as determined by the U.S. Department of Labor.  In the event that the work contract is
terminated, the employer agrees to fulfill  the three-fourths guarantee for the time that has elapsed from the start date of work specified in
the work contract to the date of termination.  The employer also agrees that it will make efforts to transfer the worker to other comparable
employment acceptable to the worker and consistent with existing immigration laws.  In situations where a transfer is not affected, the
employer agrees to return the worker at the employer’s expense to the place from which the worker, disregarding intervening employment,
came to work for the employer , or transport the worker to his/her next certified H -2A employer, whichever the worker prefers.  The employer
will also reimburse the worker the full amount of any deductions made by the employer from the worker’s pay for transportation and
subsistence expenses to the place of employment .  The employer will also pay the worker for any transportation and subsistence expenses
incurred by the worker to that employer’s place of employment.  The amounts the employer will pay for subsistence expenses per day are
those amounts disclosed in this  clearance order .  The amount of the transportation payment must not be less (and is not required to be
more) than the most economical and reasonable common carrier transportation charges for the distances involved. 20 CFR 655.122(o).
The employer is not required to pay for transportation and daily subsistence from the place of employment to a subsequent employer’s 
worksite  if the worker has contracted with a subsequent employer who has agreed to provide or pay for the worker’s transportation and 
subsistence expenses from the present employer’s worksite to the subsequent employer’s worksite.   20 CFR 655.122(h)(2). 
15. DEDUCTIONS FROM WORKER’S PAY : Employer a grees to make all deductions from the worker’s paycheck required by law.  This  job
offer discloses all deductions not required by law which the employer will make from  the worker’s paycheck and all such deductions are
reasonable, in accordance with 20 CFR 655.122(p) and 29 CFR part 531.  The wage requirements of 20 CFR 655.120 will not be met
where undisclosed or unauthorized deductions, rebates, or refunds reduce the wage payment made to the employee below the minimum
amounts required under 20 CFR part 655, subpart B, or where the employee fails to receive such amounts free and clear because the
employee kicks back directly or indirectly to the employer or to another person for the employer’s benefit the whole or part of the wage
delivered to the employee.  20 CFR 655.122(p).
16. DISCLOSURE OF WORK CONTRACT : Employer agrees to provide a copy of the work contract to an H- 2A worker no later than the time at
which the worker applies for the visa, or to a worker in corresponding employment no later than on the day work commences.  For an H-2A
worker coming to the employer from another H- 2A employer, the employer agrees to provide a copy of the work contract no later than the
time an offer of employment is made to the H -2A worker.  A copy of the work contract will be provided to each worker in a language
understood by the worker, as necessary or reasonable.  In the absence of a separate, written work contract entered into between the
employer and the worker, the required terms of this clearance order , including all Addendums, and the certified H-2A Application for
Temporary Employment Certification will be the work contract. 20 CFR 655.122(q).

H-2A Case Number: ___________ _______ __      Case Status: __________________       Determination Date : ___________ __     Validity Period : ____________ _ to ___________ __ I. Conditions of Employment and Assurance s for H-2A Agricultural Clearance Orders
By virtue of my signature below, I HEREBY CERTIFY  my knowledge of and compliance with applicable Federal, State, and local employment-
related laws and regulations, including employment-related health and safety laws, and certify the following conditions of employment: 
1. JOB OPPORTUNITY :  Employer assures that the job opportunity identified in this clearance order (hereinafter also referred to as the “job
order”) is a full -time temporary position being placed with the SWA in connection with an H-2A Application for Temporary Employment
Certification for H- 2A workers and this clearance order satisfies the requirements for agricultural clearance orders in 20 CFR 653, subpart F
and the requirements set forth in 20 CFR 655.122.  This job opportunity offers U.S. workers no less than the same benefits, wages, and
working conditions that the employer is offering, intends to offer, or will provide to H- 2A workers and complies with the requirements at 20
CFR 655, Subpart B.  The job opportunity is open to any qualified U.S. worker regardless of race, color, national origin, age, sex, religion,
handicap, or citizenship.
2. NO STRIKE, LOCKOUT, OR WORK STOPPAGE :  Employer assures that  this job opportunity, including all worksites for which the
employer is requesting H-2A labor certification does not currently have workers  on strike or being locked out in the course of a labor
dispute.  20 CFR 655.135(b).
3. HOUSING FOR WORKERS :  Employer agrees to provide for or secure housing for H- 2A workers and those workers in corresponding
employment who are not reasonably able to return to their residence at the end of the work day.  That housing complies  with the applicable
local, State, or Feder al standards and is sufficient to house the specified number of workers requested through the clearance system .  The
employer will provide the housing without charge to the worker.  Any charges for rental housing will be paid directly by the employer to the
owner or operator of the housing.  If public accommodations are provided to workers , the employer agrees to pay all housing-related
charges directly to the housing's management.  The employer agrees that charges in the form of deposits for bedding or other  similar
incidentals related to housing (e.g., utilities) must not be levied upon workers.  However, the employer may  require workers to reimburse
them for damage caused to housing by the individual worker(s) found to have been responsible for damage which is not the result of normal
wear and tear related to habitation.  When it is the prevailing practice in the area of intended employment and the occupation to provide
family housing, the employer agrees to provide family housing at no cost to workers with families who request it. 20 CFR 655.122(d),
653.501(c)(3)(vi).
Request for Conditional Access  to Intrastate or Interstate Clearance System :  Employer assures that the housing disclosed on this 
clearance order will be in full compliance with all applicable local, State, or Federal standards at least 20 calendar days before the housing 
is to be occupied. 20 CFR 653.502(a)(3).  The Certifying Officer will not certify the application until the housing has been inspected and 
approved. 
4. WORKERS’ COMPENSATION COV ERAGE :  Employer agrees to provide workers' compensation insurance coverage in compliance with
State law covering injury and disease arising out of and in the course of the worker's employment.  If the type of employment for which the
certification is sought is not covered by or is exempt from the State's workers' compensation law, the employer agrees to provide, at no cost
to the worker, insurance covering injury and disease arising out of and in the course of the worker's employment that will provide benefits at
least equal to those provided under the State workers' compensation law for other comparable employment.  20 CFR 655.122(e).
5. EMPLOYER -PROVIDED TOOLS AND EQUIPMENT :  Employer agrees to  provide to the worker, without charge or deposit charge, all
tools, supplies, and equipment required to perform the duties assigned.  20 CFR 655.122(f).
6. MEALS :  Employer agrees to provide each worker with three meals a day or furnish free and convenient cooking and kitchen facilities to the
workers that will enable the workers to prepare their own meals.  Where the employer provides the meals, the job offer will state the charge,
if any, to the worker for such meals.  The amount of meal charges is governed by 20 CFR 655.173. 20 CFR 655.122(g).
For workers engaged in the herding or production of livestock on the range, the employer agrees to provide each worker, without charge or
deposit charge, (1) either three sufficient meals a day, or free and convenient cooking facilities and adequate provision of food to enable the
worker to prepare his own meals.   To be sufficient or adequate, the meals or food provided must include a daily source of protein, vitamins,
and minerals; and (2) adequate potable water, or water that can be easily rendered potable and the means to do so.  20 CFR 655.210(e).
7. TRANSPORTATION  AND DAILY SUBSISTENCE :  Employer agrees to provide the following transportation and daily subsistence benefits
to eligible workers.  
A. Transportation to Place of Employment (Inbound)
If the worker completes 50 percent of the work contract period, and the employer did not directly provide such transportation or 
subsistence or otherwise has not yet paid the worker for such transportation or subsistence costs, the employer agrees to reimburse 
the worker for reasonable costs incurred by the worker for transportation and daily subsistence from the place from which the worker 
has come to work for the employer, whether in the U.S. or abroad to the place of employment.  The amount of the transportation 
payment must be no less (and is not required to be more) than the most economical and reasonable common carrier transportation 
charges for the distances involved.  The amount the employer will pay for daily subsistence expenses are  those amounts disclosed in 
this clearance order, which are at least as much as the employer would charge the worker for providing the worker with three meals a 
day during employment (if applicable), but in no event will less than the amount permitted under 20 CFR 655.173(a).  The employer 
understands that the F air Labor Standards Act applies independently of the H- 2A requirements and imposes obligations on employers 
regarding payment of wages. 20 CFR 655.122(h)(1). 
B. Transportation from Place of Employment (Outbound)
If the worker completes the work  contract period, or is terminated without cause, and the worker has no immediate subsequent H- 2A 
employment, the employer agrees to provide or pay for the worker's transportation and daily subsistence from the place of employment 
to the place from which the worker , disregarding intervening employment, departed to work for the employer.  Return transportation will 
not be provided to workers who voluntarily abandon employment before the end of the work contract period, or who are terminated for 
cause, if the employer follows the notification requirements in 20 CFR 655.122(n).

H-2A Case Number: ___________ _______ __      Case Status: __________________       Determination Date : ___________ __     Validity Period : ____________ _ to ___________ __ If the worker has contracted with a subsequent employer who has not agreed in such work contract to provide or pay for the worker's 
transportation and daily subsistence expenses from the employer's worksite to such subsequent employer's worksite, the employer 
must provide for such expenses.  If the worker has contracted with a subsequent employer who has agreed in such work contract to 
provide or pay for the worker's transportation and daily subsistence expenses from the employer's worksite to such subsequent 
employer's worksite, the subsequent employer must provide or pay for such expenses. 
The employer is not relieved of its obligation to provide or pay for return transportation and subsistence if an H- 2A worker is displaced 
as a result of the employer's compliance with the 50 percent rule as described in sec. 655.135(d) of this subpart with respect to the 
referrals made after the employer's date of need. 20 CFR 655.122(h)(2). 
C. Daily Transportation
Employer agrees to provide transportation between housing provided or secured by the employer and the employer’s worksite(s) at no 
cost to the worker. 20 CFR 655.122(h)(3). 
D. Compliance with Transportation Standards
Employer assures that al l employer- provided transportation will comply with all applicable Federal, State, or local laws and regulations. 
Employer agrees to provide, at a minimum, the same transportation safety standards, driver licensure, and vehicle insurance as 
required under  29 U.S.C. 1841 and 29 CFR 500.105 and 29 CFR 500.120 to 500.128.  If workers' compensation is used to cover 
transportation, in lieu of vehicle insurance, the employer will ensure that such workers' compensation covers all travel or that vehicle 
insurance exists to provide coverage for travel not covered by workers' compensation.  Employer agrees to have property damage 
insurance.  20 CFR 655.122(h)(4). 
8. THREE- FOURTHS GUARANTEE :  Employer agrees to offer the worker employment for a total number of work hours equal to at least
three- fourths of the workdays of the total period beginning with the first workday after the arrival of the worker at the place of employment or
the advertised contractual first date of need, whichever is later, and ending on the expiration date specified in the work contract or in its
extensions, if any.  20 CFR 655.122(i).
The employer may offer the worker more than the specified hours of work on a single workday.  For purposes of meeting the three -fourths 
guarantee, the worker will not be required to work for more than the number of hours specified in the job order for a workday, or on the 
worker's Sabbath or Federal holidays.  If, during the total work contract period, the employer affords the U.S. or H -2A worker less 
employment than that required under this guarantee, the employer will pay such worker the amount the worker would have earned had the 
worker, in fact, worked for the guaranteed number of days.   An employer will not be considered to have met the work guarantee if the 
empl oyer has merely offered work on three -fourths of the workdays if each workday did not consist of a full number of hours of work time as 
specified in the job order.  All hours of work actually performed may be counted by the employer in calculating whether the period of 
guaranteed employment has been met.  Any hours the worker fails to work, up to a maximum of the number of hours specified in the job 
order for a workday, when the worker has been offered an opportunity to work, and all hours of work actually performed (including voluntary 
work over 8 hours in a workday or on the worker's Sabbath or Federal holidays), may be counted by the employer in calculating whether the 
period of guaranteed employment has been met.  20 CFR 655.122(i). 
If the worker is paid on a piece rate basis, the employer agrees to use the worker's average hourly piece rate earnings or the required 
hourly wage rate, whichever is higher, to calculate the amount due under the three-fourths guarantee.  20 CFR 655.122(i). 
If the worker voluntarily abandons employment before the end of the period of employment set forth in the job order, or is terminated for 
cause, and the employer follows the notification requirements in 20 CFR 655.122(n), the worker is not entitled to the three-fourths 
guarantee.  The employer is not liable for payment of the three- fourths guarantee to an H- 2A worker whom the Department of Labor 
certifies is displaced due to the employer's requirement to hire qualified and available U.S. workers during the recruitment period set out in 
20 CPR 655.135(d), which lasts until 50 percent of the period of the work contract has elapsed (50 percent rule).  20 CFR 655.122(i). 
Important Note:  In circumstances where the work contract is terminated due to contract impossibility  under 20 CFR 655.122(o), the three-
fourths guarantee period ends on the date of termination.   
9. EARNINGS RECORDS :  Employer agrees to keep accurate and adequate records with respect to the workers' earnings at the place or
places of employment, or at one or more  established central recordkeeping offices where such records are customarily maintained.  All
records must be available for inspection and transcription by the Department of Labor or a duly authorized and designated representative,
and by the worker and representatives designated by the worker as evidenced by appropriate documentation.  Where the records are
maintained at a central recordkeeping office, other than in the place or places of employment, such records must be made available for
inspection and copying within 72 hours following notice from the Department of Labor, or a duly authorized and designated representative,
and by the worker and designated representatives.  The content of earnings records must meet all regulatory requirements and be retai ned
by the employer for a period of not less than 3 years after the date of certification by the Department of Labor.  20 CFR 655.122(j).
10. HOURS AND EARNINGS STATEMENTS:  Employer agrees to furnish to the worker on or before each payday in one or more written
statements the following information: (1) the worker's total earnings for the pay period; (2) the worker's hourly rate and/or piece rate of pay;
(3)the hours of employment offered to the worker (showing offers in accordance with the three- fourths guarantee as determined in 20 CFR

H-2A Case Number: ___________ _______ __      Case Status: __________________       Determination Date : ___________ __     Validity Period : ____________ _ to ___________ __ 11. RATES OF PAY:  The employer agrees that it will offer, advertise in its recruitment, and pay at least the Adverse Effect Wage Rate
(AEWR), the prevailing hourly wage rate, the prevailing piece rate, the agreed- upon collective bargaining rate, or the Federal or State
minimum wage rate, in effect at the time work is performed, whichever is highest.  If the worker is paid by the hour, the employer must pay
this rate for every hour or portion thereof worked during a pay period.  If the offered wage(s) disclosed in this clearance order  is/are based
on commission, bonuses, or other incentives, the employer guarantees the wage paid on a weekly, semi -monthly, or monthly basis  will
equal or exceed the AEWR, prevailing hourly wage or piece rate, the legal Federal or State minimum wage, or any agreed -upon collective
bargaining rate, whichever is highest.
If the worker is paid on a piece rate basis and at the end of the pay period the piece rate does not result in average hourly piece rate
earnings during the pay period at least equal to the amount the worker would have earned had the worker been paid at the appr opriate
hourly rate of pay, the employer agrees to supplement the worker's pay at that time so that the worker's earnings are at least as much as
the worker would have earned during the pay period if the worker had instead been paid at the appropriate hourly wage rate for each hour
worked.  20 CFR 655.120, 655.122(l).
For workers engaged in the herding or production of livestock on the range, the employer agrees to pay the worker at least the monthly 
AEWR, the agreed-upon collective bargaining wage, or the applicable minimum wage imposed by Federal or State law or judicial action, in 
effect at the time work is performed, whichever is highest, for every month of the job order period or portion thereof.  If the offered wage 
disclosed in this clearance order is  based on commissions, bonuses, or other incentives, the employer as sures that the wage paid will equal 
or exceed the monthly AEWR, the agreed -upon collective bargaining wage, or the applicable minimum wage imposed by Federal or State 
law or judicial action, whichever is highest, and will be paid to each worker free and clear without any unauthorized deductions.  The 
employer may prorate the wage for the initial and final pay periods of the job order period if its pay period does not match the beginning or 
ending dates of the job order.   The employer also may prorate the wage if an employee is voluntarily unavailable to work for personal 
reasons.  20 CFR 655.210(g). 
12. FREQUENCY OF PAY :  Employer agrees to pay workers when due based on the frequency disclosed in this clearance order.  20 CFR
655.122(m). 
13. ABANDONMENT OF EMPLOYM ENT OR TERMINATION FOR CAUSE :  If a worker voluntarily abandons employment before the end of
the contract period, or is terminated for cause, employer is not responsible for providing or paying for the subsequent transportation and
subsistence expenses of that worker, and that worker is not entitled to the three- fourths guarantee, if the employer notifies the Department
of Labor and, if applicable, the Department of Homeland Security, in writing or by any other method specified by the Department of Labor or
the Department of Homeland Security in the Federal Register, not later than 2 working days after the abandonment or termination occurs.
A worker  will be deemed to have abandoned the work contract if the worker  fails to show up for work at the regularly s cheduled time and
place for 5 consecutive work days without the consent of the employer.  20 CFR 655.122(n).
14. CONTRACT IMPOSSIBILITY : The work contract may be terminated before the end date of work specified in the work contract if
the services of the workers are no longer required for reasons beyond the control of the employer due to fire, weather, or other Act of God
that makes fulfillment of the contract impossible, as determined by the U.S. Department of Labor.  In the event that the work contract is
terminated, the employer agrees to fulfill  the three-fourths guarantee for the time that has elapsed from the start date of work specified in
the work contract to the date of termination.  The employer also agrees that it will make efforts to transfer the worker to other comparable
employment acceptable to the worker and consistent with existing immigration laws.  In situations where a transfer is not affected, the
employer agrees to return the worker at the employer’s expense to the place from which the worker, disregarding intervening employment,
came to work for the employer , or transport the worker to his/her next certified H -2A employer, whichever the worker prefers.  The employer
will also reimburse the worker the full amount of any deductions made by the employer from the worker’s pay for transportation and
subsistence expenses to the place of employment .  The employer will also pay the worker for any transportation and subsistence expenses
incurred by the worker to that employer’s place of employment.  The amounts the employer will pay for subsistence expenses per day are
those amounts disclosed in this  clearance order .  The amount of the transportation payment must not be less (and is not required to be
more) than the most economical and reasonable common carrier transportation charges for the distances involved. 20 CFR 655.122(o).
The employer is not required to pay for transportation and daily subsistence from the place of employment to a subsequent employer’s 
worksite  if the worker has contracted with a subsequent employer who has agreed to provide or pay for the worker’s transportation and 
subsistence expenses from the present employer’s worksite to the subsequent employer’s worksite.   20 CFR 655.122(h)(2). 
15. DEDUCTIONS FROM WORKER’S PAY : Employer a grees to make all deductions from the worker’s paycheck required by law.  This  job
offer discloses all deductions not required by law which the employer will make from  the worker’s paycheck and all such deductions are
reasonable, in accordance with 20 CFR 655.122(p) and 29 CFR part 531.  The wage requirements of 20 CFR 655.120 will not be met
where undisclosed or unauthorized deductions, rebates, or refunds reduce the wage payment made to the employee below the minimum
amounts required under 20 CFR part 655, subpart B, or where the employee fails to receive such amounts free and clear because the
employee kicks back directly or indirectly to the employer or to another person for the employer’s benefit the whole or part of the wage
delivered to the employee.  20 CFR 655.122(p).
16. DISCLOSURE OF WORK CONTRACT : Employer agrees to provide a copy of the work contract to an H- 2A worker no later than the time at
which the worker applies for the visa, or to a worker in corresponding employment no later than on the day work commences.  For an H-2A
worker coming to the employer from another H- 2A employer, the employer agrees to provide a copy of the work contract no later than the
time an offer of employment is made to the H -2A worker.  A copy of the work contract will be provided to each worker in a language
understood by the worker, as necessary or reasonable.  In the absence of a separate, written work contract entered into between the
employer and the worker, the required terms of this clearance order , including all Addendums, and the certified H-2A Application for
Temporary Employment Certification will be the work contract. 20 CFR 655.122(q).

H-2A Case Number: ___________ _______ __      Case Status: __________________       Determination Date : ___________ __     Validity Period : ____________ _ to ___________ __ I. Conditions of Employment and Assurance s for H-2A Agricultural Clearance Orders
By virtue of my signature below, I HEREBY CERTIFY  my knowledge of and compliance with applicable Federal, State, and local employment-
related laws and regulations, including employment-related health and safety laws, and certify the following conditions of employment: 
1. JOB OPPORTUNITY :  Employer assures that the job opportunity identified in this clearance order (hereinafter also referred to as the “job
order”) is a full -time temporary position being placed with the SWA in connection with an H-2A Application for Temporary Employment
Certification for H- 2A workers and this clearance order satisfies the requirements for agricultural clearance orders in 20 CFR 653, subpart F
and the requirements set forth in 20 CFR 655.122.  This job opportunity offers U.S. workers no less than the same benefits, wages, and
working conditions that the employer is offering, intends to offer, or will provide to H- 2A workers and complies with the requirements at 20
CFR 655, Subpart B.  The job opportunity is open to any qualified U.S. worker regardless of race, color, national origin, age, sex, religion,
handicap, or citizenship.
2. NO STRIKE, LOCKOUT, OR WORK STOPPAGE :  Employer assures that  this job opportunity, including all worksites for which the
employer is requesting H-2A labor certification does not currently have workers  on strike or being locked out in the course of a labor
dispute.  20 CFR 655.135(b).
3. HOUSING FOR WORKERS :  Employer agrees to provide for or secure housing for H- 2A workers and those workers in corresponding
employment who are not reasonably able to return to their residence at the end of the work day.  That housing complies  with the applicable
local, State, or Feder al standards and is sufficient to house the specified number of workers requested through the clearance system .  The
employer will provide the housing without charge to the worker.  Any charges for rental housing will be paid directly by the employer to the
owner or operator of the housing.  If public accommodations are provided to workers , the employer agrees to pay all housing-related
charges directly to the housing's management.  The employer agrees that charges in the form of deposits for bedding or other  similar
incidentals related to housing (e.g., utilities) must not be levied upon workers.  However, the employer may  require workers to reimburse
them for damage caused to housing by the individual worker(s) found to have been responsible for damage which is not the result of normal
wear and tear related to habitation.  When it is the prevailing practice in the area of intended employment and the occupation to provide
family housing, the employer agrees to provide family housing at no cost to workers with families who request it. 20 CFR 655.122(d),
653.501(c)(3)(vi).
Request for Conditional Access  to Intrastate or Interstate Clearance System :  Employer assures that the housing disclosed on this 
clearance order will be in full compliance with all applicable local, State, or Federal standards at least 20 calendar days before the housing 
is to be occupied. 20 CFR 653.502(a)(3).  The Certifying Officer will not certify the application until the housing has been inspected and 
approved. 
4. WORKERS’ COMPENSATION COV ERAGE :  Employer agrees to provide workers' compensation insurance coverage in compliance with
State law covering injury and disease arising out of and in the course of the worker's employment.  If the type of employment for which the
certification is sought is not covered by or is exempt from the State's workers' compensation law, the employer agrees to provide, at no cost
to the worker, insurance covering injury and disease arising out of and in the course of the worker's employment that will provide benefits at
least equal to those provided under the State workers' compensation law for other comparable employment.  20 CFR 655.122(e).
5. EMPLOYER -PROVIDED TOOLS AND EQUIPMENT :  Employer agrees to  provide to the worker, without charge or deposit charge, all
tools, supplies, and equipment required to perform the duties assigned.  20 CFR 655.122(f).
6. MEALS :  Employer agrees to provide each worker with three meals a day or furnish free and convenient cooking and kitchen facilities to the
workers that will enable the workers to prepare their own meals.  Where the employer provides the meals, the job offer will state the charge,
if any, to the worker for such meals.  The amount of meal charges is governed by 20 CFR 655.173. 20 CFR 655.122(g).
For workers engaged in the herding or production of livestock on the range, the employer agrees to provide each worker, without charge or
deposit charge, (1) either three sufficient meals a day, or free and convenient cooking facilities and adequate provision of food to enable the
worker to prepare his own meals.   To be sufficient or adequate, the meals or food provided must include a daily source of protein, vitamins,
and minerals; and (2) adequate potable water, or water that can be easily rendered potable and the means to do so.  20 CFR 655.210(e).
7. TRANSPORTATION  AND DAILY SUBSISTENCE :  Employer agrees to provide the following transportation and daily subsistence benefits
to eligible workers.  
A. Transportation to Place of Employment (Inbound)
If the worker completes 50 percent of the work contract period, and the employer did not directly provide such transportation or 
subsistence or otherwise has not yet paid the worker for such transportation or subsistence costs, the employer agrees to reimburse 
the worker for reasonable costs incurred by the worker for transportation and daily subsistence from the place from which the worker 
has come to work for the employer, whether in the U.S. or abroad to the place of employment.  The amount of the transportation 
payment must be no less (and is not required to be more) than the most economical and reasonable common carrier transportation 
charges for the distances involved.  The amount the employer will pay for daily subsistence expenses are  those amounts disclosed in 
this clearance order, which are at least as much as the employer would charge the worker for providing the worker with three meals a 
day during employment (if applicable), but in no event will less than the amount permitted under 20 CFR 655.173(a).  The employer 
understands that the F air Labor Standards Act applies independently of the H- 2A requirements and imposes obligations on employers 
regarding payment of wages. 20 CFR 655.122(h)(1). 
B. Transportation from Place of Employment (Outbound)
If the worker completes the work  contract period, or is terminated without cause, and the worker has no immediate subsequent H- 2A 
employment, the employer agrees to provide or pay for the worker's transportation and daily subsistence from the place of employment 
to the place from which the worker , disregarding intervening employment, departed to work for the employer.  Return transportation will 
not be provided to workers who voluntarily abandon employment before the end of the work contract period, or who are terminated for 
cause, if the employer follows the notification requirements in 20 CFR 655.122(n).

H-2A Case Number: ___________ _______ __      Case Status: __________________       Determination Date : ___________ __     Validity Period : ____________ _ to ___________ __ If the worker has contracted with a subsequent employer who has not agreed in such work contract to provide or pay for the worker's 
transportation and daily subsistence expenses from the employer's worksite to such subsequent employer's worksite, the employer 
must provide for such expenses.  If the worker has contracted with a subsequent employer who has agreed in such work contract to 
provide or pay for the worker's transportation and daily subsistence expenses from the employer's worksite to such subsequent 
employer's worksite, the subsequent employer must provide or pay for such expenses. 
The employer is not relieved of its obligation to provide or pay for return transportation and subsistence if an H- 2A worker is displaced 
as a result of the employer's compliance with the 50 percent rule as described in sec. 655.135(d) of this subpart with respect to the 
referrals made after the employer's date of need. 20 CFR 655.122(h)(2). 
C. Daily Transportation
Employer agrees to provide transportation between housing provided or secured by the employer and the employer’s worksite(s) at no 
cost to the worker. 20 CFR 655.122(h)(3). 
D. Compliance with Transportation Standards
Employer assures that al l employer- provided transportation will comply with all applicable Federal, State, or local laws and regulations. 
Employer agrees to provide, at a minimum, the same transportation safety standards, driver licensure, and vehicle insurance as 
required under  29 U.S.C. 1841 and 29 CFR 500.105 and 29 CFR 500.120 to 500.128.  If workers' compensation is used to cover 
transportation, in lieu of vehicle insurance, the employer will ensure that such workers' compensation covers all travel or that vehicle 
insurance exists to provide coverage for travel not covered by workers' compensation.  Employer agrees to have property damage 
insurance.  20 CFR 655.122(h)(4). 
8. THREE- FOURTHS GUARANTEE :  Employer agrees to offer the worker employment for a total number of work hours equal to at least
three- fourths of the workdays of the total period beginning with the first workday after the arrival of the worker at the place of employment or
the advertised contractual first date of need, whichever is later, and ending on the expiration date specified in the work contract or in its
extensions, if any.  20 CFR 655.122(i).
The employer may offer the worker more than the specified hours of work on a single workday.  For purposes of meeting the three -fourths 
guarantee, the worker will not be required to work for more than the number of hours specified in the job order for a workday, or on the 
worker's Sabbath or Federal holidays.  If, during the total work contract period, the employer affords the U.S. or H -2A worker less 
employment than that required under this guarantee, the employer will pay such worker the amount the worker would have earned had the 
worker, in fact, worked for the guaranteed number of days.   An employer will not be considered to have met the work guarantee if the 
empl oyer has merely offered work on three -fourths of the workdays if each workday did not consist of a full number of hours of work time as 
specified in the job order.  All hours of work actually performed may be counted by the employer in calculating whether the period of 
guaranteed employment has been met.  Any hours the worker fails to work, up to a maximum of the number of hours specified in the job 
order for a workday, when the worker has been offered an opportunity to work, and all hours of work actually performed (including voluntary 
work over 8 hours in a workday or on the worker's Sabbath or Federal holidays), may be counted by the employer in calculating whether the 
period of guaranteed employment has been met.  20 CFR 655.122(i). 
If the worker is paid on a piece rate basis, the employer agrees to use the worker's average hourly piece rate earnings or the required 
hourly wage rate, whichever is higher, to calculate the amount due under the three-fourths guarantee.  20 CFR 655.122(i). 
If the worker voluntarily abandons employment before the end of the period of employment set forth in the job order, or is terminated for 
cause, and the employer follows the notification requirements in 20 CFR 655.122(n), the worker is not entitled to the three-fourths 
guarantee.  The employer is not liable for payment of the three- fourths guarantee to an H- 2A worker whom the Department of Labor 
certifies is displaced due to the employer's requirement to hire qualified and available U.S. workers during the recruitment period set out in 
20 CPR 655.135(d), which lasts until 50 percent of the period of the work contract has elapsed (50 percent rule).  20 CFR 655.122(i). 
Important Note:  In circumstances where the work contract is terminated due to contract impossibility  under 20 CFR 655.122(o), the three-
fourths guarantee period ends on the date of termination.   
9. EARNINGS RECORDS :  Employer agrees to keep accurate and adequate records with respect to the workers' earnings at the place or
places of employment, or at one or more  established central recordkeeping offices where such records are customarily maintained.  All
records must be available for inspection and transcription by the Department of Labor or a duly authorized and designated representative,
and by the worker and representatives designated by the worker as evidenced by appropriate documentation.  Where the records are
maintained at a central recordkeeping office, other than in the place or places of employment, such records must be made available for
inspection and copying within 72 hours following notice from the Department of Labor, or a duly authorized and designated representative,
and by the worker and designated representatives.  The content of earnings records must meet all regulatory requirements and be retai ned
by the employer for a period of not less than 3 years after the date of certification by the Department of Labor.  20 CFR 655.122(j).
10. HOURS AND EARNINGS STATEMENTS:  Employer agrees to furnish to the worker on or before each payday in one or more written
statements the following information: (1) the worker's total earnings for the pay period; (2) the worker's hourly rate and/or piece rate of pay;
(3)the hours of employment offered to the worker (showing offers in accordance with the three- fourths guarantee as determined in 20 CFR
655.122(i), separate from any hours offered over and above the guarantee); (4) the hours actually worked by the worker; (5) an itemization
of all deductions made from the worker's wages; (6) If piece rates are used, the units produced daily; (7) beginning and ending dates of the
pay period; and (8) the employer's name, address and FEIN.  20 CFR 655.122(k).
For workers engaged in the herding or production of livestock on the range, the employer is exempt from recording and furnishing the hours 
actually worked each day, the time the worker begins and ends each workday, as well as the nature and amount of work performe d, but 
otherwise must comply with the earnings records and hours and earnings statement requirements set out in 20 CFR 655.122(j) and (k) .  
The employer agrees to keep daily records indicating whether the site of the employee's work was on the range or off the range.  If the 
employer prorates a worker's wage because of the worker's voluntary absence for personal reasons, it must also keep a record of the 
reason for the worker's absence. 20 CFR 655.210(f).

H-2A Case Number: ___________ _______ __      Case Status: __________________       Determination Date : ___________ __     Validity Period : ____________ _ to ___________ __ 11. RATES OF PAY:  The employer agrees that it will offer, advertise in its recruitment, and pay at least the Adverse Effect Wage Rate
(AEWR), the prevailing hourly wage rate, the prevailing piece rate, the agreed- upon collective bargaining rate, or the Federal or State
minimum wage rate, in effect at the time work is performed, whichever is highest.  If the worker is paid by the hour, the employer must pay
this rate for every hour or portion thereof worked during a pay period.  If the offered wage(s) disclosed in this clearance order  is/are based
on commission, bonuses, or other incentives, the employer guarantees the wage paid on a weekly, semi -monthly, or monthly basis  will
equal or exceed the AEWR, prevailing hourly wage or piece rate, the legal Federal or State minimum wage, or any agreed -upon collective
bargaining rate, whichever is highest.
If the worker is paid on a piece rate basis and at the end of the pay period the piece rate does not result in average hourly piece rate
earnings during the pay period at least equal to the amount the worker would have earned had the worker been paid at the appr opriate
hourly rate of pay, the employer agrees to supplement the worker's pay at that time so that the worker's earnings are at least as much as
the worker would have earned during the pay period if the worker had instead been paid at the appropriate hourly wage rate for each hour
worked.  20 CFR 655.120, 655.122(l).
For workers engaged in the herding or production of livestock on the range, the employer agrees to pay the worker at least the monthly 
AEWR, the agreed-upon collective bargaining wage, or the applicable minimum wage imposed by Federal or State law or judicial action, in 
effect at the time work is performed, whichever is highest, for every month of the job order period or portion thereof.  If the offered wage 
disclosed in this clearance order is  based on commissions, bonuses, or other incentives, the employer as sures that the wage paid will equal 
or exceed the monthly AEWR, the agreed -upon collective bargaining wage, or the applicable minimum wage imposed by Federal or State 
law or judicial action, whichever is highest, and will be paid to each worker free and clear without any unauthorized deductions.  The 
employer may prorate the wage for the initial and final pay periods of the job order period if its pay period does not match the beginning or 
ending dates of the job order.   The employer also may prorate the wage if an employee is voluntarily unavailable to work for personal 
reasons.  20 CFR 655.210(g). 
12. FREQUENCY OF PAY :  Employer agrees to pay workers when due based on the frequency disclosed in this clearance order.  20 CFR
655.122(m). 
13. ABANDONMENT OF EMPLOYM ENT OR TERMINATION FOR CAUSE :  If a worker voluntarily abandons employment before the end of
the contract period, or is terminated for cause, employer is not responsible for providing or paying for the subsequent transportation and
subsistence expenses of that worker, and that worker is not entitled to the three- fourths guarantee, if the employer notifies the Department
of Labor and, if applicable, the Department of Homeland Security, in writing or by any other method specified by the Department of Labor or
the Department of Homeland Security in the Federal Register, not later than 2 working days after the abandonment or termination occurs.
A worker  will be deemed to have abandoned the work contract if the worker  fails to show up for work at the regularly s cheduled time and
place for 5 consecutive work days without the consent of the employer.  20 CFR 655.122(n).
14. CONTRACT IMPOSSIBILITY : The work contract may be terminated before the end date of work specified in the work contract if
the services of the workers are no longer required for reasons beyond the control of the employer due to fire, weather, or other Act of God
that makes fulfillment of the contract impossible, as determined by the U.S. Department of Labor.  In the event that the work contract is
terminated, the employer agrees to fulfill  the three-fourths guarantee for the time that has elapsed from the start date of work specified in
the work contract to the date of termination.  The employer also agrees that it will make efforts to transfer the worker to other comparable
employment acceptable to the worker and consistent with existing immigration laws.  In situations where a transfer is not affected, the
employer agrees to return the worker at the employer’s expense to the place from which the worker, disregarding intervening employment,
came to work for the employer , or transport the worker to his/her next certified H -2A employer, whichever the worker prefers.  The employer
will also reimburse the worker the full amount of any deductions made by the employer from the worker’s pay for transportation and
subsistence expenses to the place of employment .  The employer will also pay the worker for any transportation and subsistence expenses
incurred by the worker to that employer’s place of employment.  The amounts the employer will pay for subsistence expenses per day are
those amounts disclosed in this  clearance order .  The amount of the transportation payment must not be less (and is not required to be
more) than the most economical and reasonable common carrier transportation charges for the distances involved. 20 CFR 655.122(o).
The employer is not required to pay for transportation and daily subsistence from the place of employment to a subsequent employer’s 
worksite  if the worker has contracted with a subsequent employer who has agreed to provide or pay for the worker’s transportation and 
subsistence expenses from the present employer’s worksite to the subsequent employer’s worksite.   20 CFR 655.122(h)(2). 
15. DEDUCTIONS FROM WORKER’S PAY : Employer a grees to make all deductions from the worker’s paycheck required by law.  This  job
offer discloses all deductions not required by law which the employer will make from  the worker’s paycheck and all such deductions are
reasonable, in accordance with 20 CFR 655.122(p) and 29 CFR part 531.  The wage requirements of 20 CFR 655.120 will not be met
where undisclosed or unauthorized deductions, rebates, or refunds reduce the wage payment made to the employee below the minimum
amounts required under 20 CFR part 655, subpart B, or where the employee fails to receive such amounts free and clear because the
employee kicks back directly or indirectly to the employer or to another person for the employer’s benefit the whole or part of the wage
delivered to the employee.  20 CFR 655.122(p).
16. DISCLOSURE OF WORK CONTRACT : Employer agrees to provide a copy of the work contract to an H- 2A worker no later than the time at
which the worker applies for the visa, or to a worker in corresponding employment no later than on the day work commences.  For an H-2A
worker coming to the employer from another H- 2A employer, the employer agrees to provide a copy of the work contract no later than the
time an offer of employment is made to the H -2A worker.  A copy of the work contract will be provided to each worker in a language
understood by the worker, as necessary or reasonable.  In the absence of a separate, written work contract entered into between the
employer and the worker, the required terms of this clearance order , including all Addendums, and the certified H-2A Application for
Temporary Employment Certification will be the work contract. 20 CFR 655.122(q).
